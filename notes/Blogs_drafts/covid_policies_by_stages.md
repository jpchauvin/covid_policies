#  How government policies change as COVID moves stages


An intuitive way of thinking about the progression of a country's infection wave is to divide it into stages.  This provides insights on how infection waves behave in different places and allows us that can be observed in publicly available data.

      

## What have been the policy responses at each stage?

Country differences in the duration of the stages of COVID-19 spread reflect, in no small part, differences in the type, scope, and intensity of government responses.

Here I discuss how countries have reacted

In a previous post, where I discussed where countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are in the fist wave of COVID-19 infections, I identified five distinct stages of the wave that can be observed in the data.

## Mobility-related policies

## Physical distancing

At the time of writing, most countries in the world are still in the stage of accelerating community spread.  This includes most countries in Latin America with the exception of Chile and Ecuador, whom appear to have entered a decelerating stage.

## Emergency investments


## Information-related policies

Countries have had different priorities as the first covid wage has progressed.
