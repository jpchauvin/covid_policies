   Urban population prediction error (minimum wage /formal/informal/two urban sectors)*** & \multicolumn{1}{p{7.055em}}{1991, 2000, 2010} & Average across cities of the value of the error defined in equation 4. For each city, the error is computed using as inputs the ratio between employed and non-employed working age-urban population, and the ratio between the average rural wage and the average minimum/urban formal/urban informal/urban wage.  \\ 
    Urban unemployment prediction error (minimum wage /formal/informal/two urban sectors)*** & \multicolumn{1}{p{7.055em}}{1991, 2000, 2010} &   Average across cities of the value of the error defined in equation 5. For each city, the error is computed using as inputs the ratio between non-employed and employed working age-urban population and the ratio between the average minimum/urban formal/urban informal/urban wage and the average rural wage.  \\
    Urban population prediction error with housing market*** & \multicolumn{1}{p{7.055em}}{1991,  2010} &   Average across cities of the value of the error defined in equation 9. For each city, the error is computed using as inputs the ratio between employed and non-employed working age-urban population, the ratio between the average rural wage and the average urban wage, and the ratio between rural and urban housing rent to the power of 0.33.  \\
    Urban unemployment prediction error with housing market*** & \multicolumn{1}{p{7.055em}}{1991, 2010} &   Average across cities of the value of the error defined in equation 10. For each city, the error is computed using as inputs the ratio between non-employed and employed working age-urban population, the ratio between the average urban wage and the average rural wage, and the ratio between rural and urban housing rent to the power of 0.33.    \\
