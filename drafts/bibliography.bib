abstract = {This paper characterizes the gross and net migration flows between rural and urban areas in India during the period 1983-2008. Using individual data from the National Sample Survey of India we show that the 5-year gross migration flows constitute about 10{\%} of India's labor force and are stable over time. Migrants tend to be younger and more educated than nonmigrants. They also are more likely to work part-time and in regular employment and less likely to be self-employed. Migrants from rural and urban areas have higher mean and median wages relative to nonmigrants in the same locations. However, there are differences in the size of the wage gaps along the wage distribution and their dynamics over time.},

abstract = {We analyse the impact of internal migration in China on natives' labour market outcomes. We find evidence of a large positive correlation of the city share of migrants with natives' wages. Using different sets of control variables and instruments suggests that the effect is causal. The large total migrant impact (+10{\%} when one moves from the first to the third quartile of the migrant variable distribution) arises from gains due to complementarity with natives in the production function (+6.4{\%}), and from gains due to agglomeration economies (+3.3{\%}). Finally, we find some evidence of a stronger effect for skilled natives than for unskilled, as expected from theory. Overall, our findings support large nominal wage gains that can be expected from further migration and urbanisation in China.},

abstract = {While considerable progress has been made in understanding the way particular aspects of internal migration, such as its intensity, age profile and spatial impact, vary between countries around the world, little attention to date has been given to establishing how these dimensions of migration interact in different national settings. We use recently developed measures of internal migration that are scale-independent to compare the overall intensity, age composition, spatial impact, and distance profile of internal migration in 19 Latin American countries. Comparisons reveal substantial cross-national variation but cluster analysis suggests the different dimensions of migration evolve systematically to form a broad sequence characterised by low intensities, young ages at migration, unbalanced flows and high friction of distance at lower levels of development, trending to high intensities, an older age profile of migration, more closely balanced flows and lower friction of distance at later stages of development. However, the transition is not linear and local contingencies, such as international migration and political control, often distort the migration-development nexus, leading to unique migration patterns in individual national contexts.},

Exploiting the wide availability of census data, we propose a method to quantify the internal migration impacts on local population structures, and estimate these impacts for eight large Latin American cities. We show that internal migration generally had small feminizing, downgrading educational, and demographic window effects: reducing the local sex ratio, lowering the average years of schooling, and raising the share of working-age population due to an increased young adult population. Over time, a rise in the proportion of males and a drop in the share of the young adult population moving into cities reduced the feminizing and demographic window effects. Concurrently, a rise in the average years of schooling associated with people moving into cities attenuated the downgrading impact of internal migration on local education levels.},

abstract = {"The migration of labor from rural to urban areas is an important part of the urbanization process in developing countries. Even though it has been the focus of abundant research over the past five decades, some key policy questions have not found clear answers yet. To what extent is internal migration a desirable phenomenon and under what circumstances? Should governments intervene and, if so, with what types of interventions? What should be their policy objectives? To shed light on these important issues, the authors survey the existing theoretical models and their conflicting policy implications and discuss the policies that may be justified based on recent relevant empirical studies. A key limitation is that much of the empirical literature does not provide structural tests of the theoretical models, but only provides partial findings that can support or invalidate intuitions and in that sense, support or invalidate the policy implications of the models. The authors' broad assessment of the literature is that migration can be beneficial or at least be turned into a beneficial phenomenon so that in general migration restrictions are not desirable. They also identify some data issues and research topics which merit further investigation. "--World Bank web site.},

The analysis uses panel data of 2200 rural households and data from a migrant tracking survey of 299 migrants from Vietnam. The findings show that migrants coming from rural households that faced a higher number of idiosyncratic shocks increase their stays in the cities, while those from households that experienced covariate shocks such as floods, droughts, or economic shocks shorten the lengths of their stays in the cities. An increased length of migration is also observed among migrants and households with higher human capital. Furthermore, a decreased income gap between rural and urban provinces due to the higher economic growth in the cities increases the duration of migration. With respect to the migration intensity, migrants intend to return sooner when they face shocks in the cities and the living conditions at their original places improve.

We first illustrate the activities of immigrants after returning. We show that more than half of the returning migrants are economically active after return, and most of them engage in entrepreneurial activities. We then develop a model where migrants decide simultaneously about the optimal migration duration, and their after-return activities. Guided by this model, we specify and estimate an empirical model, where the after-return activity, and the optimal migration duration are simultaneously chosen. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper explores the applicability of the Harris-Todaro (HT) framework outside its traditional use, by modelling frontier-metropolis migration in Canada. If appropriate, the framework can potentially be used in other countries with similar regional dichotomies, such as Russia and Australia. The paper argues that the HT model is generally applicable in the context of migration from the resource frontier to large metropolitan areas of the Canadian south, although it requires several modifications. The classic HT model is extended to account for northern labour-force heterogeneity (Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal), the possibility of having or losing jobs in the declining and undiversified frontier economy, and living cost differentials. Further analysis is focused on Aboriginal migration from isolated northern communities. The plausibility of the modified HT model is demonstrated using an empirical test in which the model is used to assess migration probabilities of Aboriginal labour migrants. These new insights into the mechanisms of frontier-metropolis migration could provide a better basis for developing planning strategies, aimed to sustain human capital in the Canadian North, and for optimizing welfare policies both in the North and in the South.},

Brueckner and Zenou (1999) (hereafter BZ) argue that a model where migration equalizes expected wages between city and countryside may overlook another important force that equilibrates the process of rural-urban migration. This force is the migration-induced rise in the urban cost of living, which occurs principally through escalation of urban land rents as the city population expands. Land-rent escalation, which tends to limit rural-urban migration, provides an important additional force that may help determine city sizes in developing countries. The present paper provides a simpler alternative to BZ's analysis by assuming that urban residents smooth their income as they cycle between formal and informal employment. This allows migration decisions to be based on the expected wage, as in the usual HT framework, in a model that includes a land market. The analysis shows that this modified framework generates results slightly different from those of BZ.},

@article{Kennan2011,
abstract = {The paper develops a tractable econometric model of optimal migration, focusing on expected income as the main economic influence on migration. The model improves on previous work in two respects: it covers optimal sequences of location decisions (rather than a single once-for-all choice), and it allows for many alternative location choices. The model is estimated using panel data from the NLSY on white males with a high school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects. The results suggest that the link between income and migration decisions is driven both by geographic differences in mean wages and by a tendency to move in search of a better locational match when the income realization in the current location is unfavorable.},

We emphasize the impact of local density on productivity, but we also consider many other local determinants supported by theory. Empirical issues are then addressed. The most important concerns are about endogeneity at the local and individual levels, the choice of a productivity measure between wages and total-factor productivity, and the roles of spatial scale, firms' characteristics, and functional forms. Estimated impacts of local determinants of productivity, employment, and firms' location choices are surveyed for both developed and developing economies.

Results based on a slum survey in four Indian cities highlight the importance of various informal channels through which urban jobs are accessed. However, these networks reduce the probability of upward mobility, as network extension leads to excess supplies of labour relative to demand. The issue of upward mobility has also been examined by constructing a well-being (deprivation) index based on the factor analysis of a large number of social, economic, demographic, education and health-specific variables. Although findings are indicative of improvements in the well-being of migrant workers over time, several of the long-duration migrants and natives in the cities still lead a low quality life. The paper, therefore, argues in favour of urban employment programmes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.},

Using a dynamic stochastic model of urbanization with endogenous demand for property rights over land use, we demonstrate that the costly provision of those rights may result in both residential informality that can persist over time and suboptimal urbanization whereby cities are too small and insufficiently productive. In developing countries, because land administrations in charge of issuing titles are difficult to reform, achieving the second best may require acceptance of some level of informality in spite of the negative externalities stemming from informal land tenure and informal settlements. This may not be easily implemented as urban elites may favor overall welfare-reducing policies that over-evict informal dwellers.},

abstract = {This paper builds upon earlier work of mine which explored the determinants of population migration in Colombia. As before, the basic proposition is that areas' economic opportunities play a central role in determining the spatial allocation of the population. My earlier paper used published data from the 1973 Colombian Census of Population to establish that the rates of net lifetime migration into Colombia's 23 provinces (or, as they are known in Colombia, "departments") are associated with those areas' labor market conditions. The present paper uses unpublished data for 12 zones (six regions, rural and urban segments of each) to analyze the causes of place-to-place migration flows (lifetime and recent) for the population as a whole and for eight specific demographic groups (four educational categories and the two sexes). Several hypotheses are formulated and tested. The results give strong support to the economic model of migration, overall and in explaining differences in migration behavior among demographic groups. For Colombia this is particularly useful since some past work has been interpreted to the contrary.

We show that children are especially vulnerable, and that the combination of malnutrition and recurrent diarrhoea leads to stunted growth and longer-term effects on cognitive development. We find that the scientific literature on slum health is underdeveloped in comparison to urban health, and poverty and health. This shortcoming is important because health is affected by factors arising from the shared physical and social environment, which have effects beyond those of poverty alone. In the second paper we will consider what can be done to improve health and make recommendations for the development of slum health as a field of study.},

abstract = {Historically, urban growth required enough development to grow and transport significant agricultural surpluses or a government effective enough to build an empire. But there has been an explosion of poor mega-cities over the last 30 years. A simple urban model illustrates that in closed economies, agricultural prosperity leads to more urbanization, but that in an open economy, urbanization increases with agricultural desperation. The challenge of developing world mega-cities is that poverty and weak governance reduce the ability to address the negative externalities that come with density. This paper models the connection between urban size and institutional failure, and shows that urban anonymity causes institutions to break down. For large cities with weak governments, draconian policies may be the only way to curb negative externalities, suggesting a painful trade-off between dictatorship and disorder. A simple model suggests that private provision of infrastructure to reduce negative externalities is less costly when city populations are low or institutions are strong, but that public provision can cost less in bigger cities.},

This has led scholars to believe that development and urbanization are not always correlated, either across space or over time. In this paper, we use historical data at both the country level and city level over the five centuries between 1500-2010 to revisit the topic of "urbanization without growth" (Fay and Opal, 2000). In particular, we first establish that, although urbanization and income remain highly correlated within any given year, urbanization is 25-30 percentage points higher in 2010 than in 1500 at every level of income per capita. Second, while historically this shift in urbanization rates was more noticeable at the upper tail of the income distribution, i.e. for richer countries, it is now particularly visible at the lower tail, i.e. for poorer countries. Third, these patterns suggest that different factors may have explained the shift in different periods of time. We use the discussion of these factors as an opportunity to provide a survey of the literature and summarize our knowledge of what drives the urbanization process over time.},

The first step in the explanation is to note that there are politically determined minimum wages in the urban areas that prevent wages from adjusting to achieve full employment for all those who come to the urban areas. The equilibrium distribution of potential workers between the rural and urban areas equates the marginal product of labor in agriculture to the expected wage in the urban area, i.e., the product of the wage and the probability of employment.},

abstract = {High levels of racial segregation persist in the United States. We argue that land use control is an important tool for maintaining this pattern. Cities have the capacity to make housing and public goods available or not, thereby affecting the demographics of the community. Since the early 20 th century white communities have invested significant effort into protecting their homogeneity. We draw on precinct level initiative elections from several California cities to show that, even today, whiter neighborhoods are more supportive of restricting development. We draw on ballot statements to offer evidence that voters were likely to have understood the consequences of their vote for density, housing prices, and housing availability-which in turn, affect segregation. Then, we show that these results are also reflected in the aggregate. Cities that were whiter than their metropolitan area in 1970 are more likely to have restrictive land use patterns in 2006. We use distance from slave ports as an instrument for the city's racial makeup. Finally, relying on Federal Fair Housing Act lawsuits to generate changes in land use policy, we show that restrictive land use helps to explain metropolitan area segregation patterns over time. In sum, we build a compelling case for the important power of land use in maintaining racial segregation.},

abstract = {Informal settlements exist with formal settlements and are structurally interdependent with them. Housing informality also emerges as a consequence of certain institutional and other constraints on the urban land market. This article elaborates on these complex interdependencies and sheds light on potential policy options to mitigate informality itself to provide a new framework for dialogue between urban planners and economists in Third World cities. It begins with a review of the multiple forms that informality takes and the problems it poses to individuals and society. It then describes how urban economic theory has dealt with the issue, highlighting the failure of conventional models. Following this, it describes the rational housing choices of low income households and how current policies intended to remedy the results of these decisions instead aggravate informality. Finally, the article offers some new ways to apply conventional land policy instruments to achieve this goal.},

While formal developers build houses renting land from landowners, informal developers use land for free. However, informal developers must incur defensive expenditures to avoid government intervention. In equilibrium, at any distance of the central business district (CBD), informal developers use land until the value of the marginal productivity of land equals the defensive expenditures per unit of land. The model shows the land allocated to produce short informal (tall formal) buildings increases (decreases) with distance to the CBD. Thus, the model introduces a new source of spatial variation of building height. The model also shows that a higher level of informal housing increases the spatial size of a city and reduces the height of its buildings.},

We provide consistent estimates of each neighbourhood's accessibility to employment opportunities using innovative datasets. We concentrate on the three main commuting modes (private cars, walking, and informal shared mini-buses) and identify sharp disparities with respect to job accessibility by commuting mode. While most jobs can be reached by car within 60 minutes from any neighbourhood, only between 20 to 30{\%} of formal jobs on average are accessible in the same timeframe by the more popular minibus. We complement these findings by looking at how accessibility is related to individual labour outcomes. Our findings suggest that a better access to employment opportunities is correlated with a higher likelihood of employment and a lower probability of engaging in the informal sector. Women tend to be the most affected. Supporting these findings, we also see firms located in neighbourhoods with a greater labour pool reach being less likely to report unfilled vacancies. On the whole, while descriptive, the analysis strongly suggests that Accra's lack of efficient connectivity harms labour and firm economic outcomes.},

Using a geographically-referenced dataset on new housing developments, this paper estimates how households value accessibility in Mexico City. Results are shown considering road accessibility to formal employment subcenters (private accessibility) and distance to the main public transport stations in the city (public accessibility). Results suggest that accessibility to employment subcenters is valued as an amenity by households but being closer to a Metro station is perceived as a disamenity. Moreover, households located in neighborhoods with a greater proportion of informal workers and with lower education levels give a lower value to private accessibility than households located in neighborhoods with a lower proportion of informal workers or in high-educated neighborhoods. These results are evidence of the existence of spatial segregation in the city where disadvantaged households are segregated, not only because of their economic conditions, but because they are located farther away from employment opportunities. The results in this work stress the importance of thinking about integrated land use and transport policies.},

After documenting variation in mode choice, urban form, and vehicle ownership, we fit a multinomial logit model to data from 2.5 million commuters who reported a work commute on the 2015 Intercensus. We estimate whether a person commutes by transit, car, or walking/biking as a function of commuters' gender, age, employment status, household income, and seven measures of urban form and transportation supply. Across urban areas, commuters are less likely to drive in dense urban areas where jobs are spatially concentrated jobs and near population centers. Commuters are also less likely to drive in areas with better public transit supply and less roadway. Collectively the measures of urban form are as strongly related to the probability someone commutes to work by car as household income. Population density plays a particularly strongly role with an estimated elasticity four times as strong as recent studies from US urban areas. Taken together, our findings suggest that land use planning and transportation investments can and do influence commute patterns. Recent public policies have almost certainly contributed to increased, rather than decreased driving and associated congestion, pollution, and traffic fatalities.},

@article{Barufi2017,
abstract = {The spatial mismatch hypothesis states that a lack of connection to job opportunities may affect an individual's prospects in the labour market, especially for low-skilled workers. This phenomenon is especially observed in large urban areas, in which low-skilled minorities tend to live far away from jobs and face geographical barriers to finding and keeping jobs. This paper aims to investigate whether this negative relationship between spatial mismatch and labour market outcomes is valid in Brazil after controlling for individual characteristics. Our conclusions indicate that there is no clear relation between different measures of accessibility to jobs and the probability of being unemployed. However, for wages there is a clear correlation, which is stronger in larger metropolitan areas than in the country and has a more detrimental effect for low-skilled workers. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the spatial mismatch in urban labour markets in Brazil. For the empirical literature in the country, this is an original contribution, as the comparison of intra-urban labour market dynamics of different urban areas provide a more comprehensive perspective of the role city size may play in local labour markets. Given the exploratory nature of this work, our results still rely on strong identification hypotheses to avoid potential bias related to simultaneous location decisions of workers and firms within the city. Even if these conditions do not hold, the results are still meaningful as they provide a better understanding of the conditional distribution of wages and the unemployment rate in the biggest metropolitan areas of Brazil.},

Specifically, it assesses the impact of distance to city centre on: (1) market price of the housing unit, (2) households' commuting expenses; and (3) households' access to social networks. It bases its findings on 150 surveys of households living in subsidised housing units in the cities of Goiania, Brazil; Barranquilla, Colombia; and Puebla, Mexico. Distance to centre has a significant impact on all dimensions considered: the average market price for a peripheral housing unit is about 40{\%} less than for a central one. Workers who live in the periphery spend twice the money and three times the time in commuting than those who live in central locations. Three-quarters of centrally located households visit relatives once a month or more, while only a third of peripherally located households do so. In addition, households residing in the periphery expressed their concern about being concentrated in homogeneously low-income areas. These impacts are a concern inasmuch as these housing units are solely built for improving the material conditions of low-income households, who are a captive market with very limited housing options.},

abstract = {Even though mobility is a requirement for participation in “modern life”, the truth is that mobility is unevenly distributed and it constitutes a field of contestation and dispute among social classes. Mobility does not derive from individual decisions or free choices. On the contrary, it is the result of the interaction between individual attributes and social structure. To grasp this interaction, it is necessary to go well beyond observed mobility. This paper explores the unequal access to urban opportunities among different social classes in Montevideo. It does so by computing potential public transport accessibility to two types of crucial opportunities: jobs and education. The paper findings show an unequal distribution of potential mobility, especially for jobs and upper level public education. Primary public schools are an exception, revealing the spatial footprint of the mature Uruguayan social protection network at this level. This paper's approach allows to identify and describe various fields of contestation such as urban form, transit network, the state provision of public goods (in the case of education), through examining the effects of uneven mobility on social goods access and, as a result, on social equity.},

abstract = {Inadequate housing has become endemic to Latin American cities for over six decades. All that has changed has been who is going where. In the 1960s, the rural poor who came to the city solved their housing needs by building their own informal settlements on peri-urban lands. Today, the urban poor relocate to peri-urban housing complexes built by the private sector with state subsidies. Why have these new housing units for low-income households been built in peri-urban areas? This paper examines some of the mechanisms behind the location of the urban poor in cities, with a specific focus on the role developers have played in the construction of affordable housing in peri-urban areas of Brazil and, Mexico. The paper explores these mechanisms through interviews with affordable housing developers. We found that economies of scale – and not land prices – explain developers' preference for building in peripheral areas. Initial savings that accrue to developers due to lower land prices in the periphery are offset by the cost of having to build basic onsite infrastructure. Plus, large lots – which are available almost exclusively in urban peripheries – enable developers to achieve significant cost savings because these large lots make it possible for developers to build more than 500 units. In addition, weaker municipal regulations and fewer bidders, both of which are typical for projects in difficult-to-access peripheral locations, make for a shorter and easier approval process for these large housing projects.},

One proposes that they help to lift households out of rural poverty and onto a path to prosperity through affordable access to urban opportunities. The other suggests that the debilitating conditions confine residents to enduring hardship and insecurity. South Africa is an important test case because of the extent of social and spatial inequalities, and the policy ambivalence towards shack settlements. Preliminary evidence indicates that employment rates are much closer to formal urban areas than to rural areas, but conditions of employment are noticeably worse. Other forms of data are required to assess the magnitude and timescale of economic progression for households.},

This reduced accessibility to formal employment would suggest that the poor have longer commutes. However, observed travel times show that low-income workers actually have the shortest commutes.

The unemployment effect is first analyzed using a simple minimum-wage model. An efficiency-wage model is then adopted in order to endogenize both unemployment and wages. Under both models, suburban housing discrimination leads to a higher unemployment rate for blacks in the central city than in the suburbs. Under the efficiency-wage model, black wages are also lower in the center. The analysis thus generates a link between unemployment and a seemingly unrelated phenomenon: racial discrimination in the housing market.},

A sample of approximately 50,000 adults in two-earner households in urban areas distributed across the United States is selected from public use microdata from the 1980 census and used to estimate a simultaneous model to explain commute to work behavior of men and women. The model is estimated separately for households that did and did not change residences in the past year. The impacts of the new residences on the commute times of both male and female workers, holding other variables constant, are compared. We conclude that residential selection does favor males relative to females, although there is evidence that this advantage is eliminated as the ratio of female to male earnings in the same household narrows. {\textcopyright} 1986, Sage Publications.

abstract = {Access to opportunities through public transport can have different impacts on individual's life especially in developing countries where opportunities are limited, job informality rates are high, and socioeconomic characteristics gaps are big. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between job informality and accessibility to employment by public transport in S{\~{a}}o Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR), Brazil. To do so, we calculate a cumulative-opportunity measure of accessibility to jobs for 633 areas within the SPMR. We use a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model to estimate the effect of job accessibility on the likelihood of being informally employed, controlling for individual and other area characteristics. To account for informal sector heterogeneity, two regression models are generated: one for the workers earning below minimum wage and one for the workers earning above minimum wage. The results show that accessibility to jobs is unevenly distributed across the region, largely concentrated in the core of the region, and especially in the high-income areas. The regression results show that for workers earning less than the minimum wage, a higher level of accessibility to jobs by public transport is associated with a lower likelihood of being a worker in the informal job sector. For informal workers earning more than the minimum wage, car ownership seem to be more relevant than transit accessibility in determining the likelihood of being part of the informal job sector. In light of these findings, increasing accessibility by public transport through either expanding transit services to areas with high informality rates to have a better access to formal jobs or supporting the decentralization of formal jobs may be a way to achieve reductions in informality rates, especially among those earning less than the minimum wage.},

abstract = {Expanding employment opportunities for citizens has become an increasingly central goal of public policy in the United States. Prior work has considered that the inability of households to spatially access jobs may be a driver of unemployment. The provision of public transportation provides a viable policy lever to increase the number of job opportunities available to households. Previous research has yielded mixed results regarding whether household location is an important factor in determining employment status. Several papers have identified mobility as a limiting factor for obtaining a job, particularly in regards to private vehicle ownership. The location of economically developed neighbourhoods and the citing of public transportation are conceivably codetermined, presenting an endogenous relationship. It is therefore unclear if public transportation access is actually contributing to neighbourhood job market outcomes. This paper will use the incidence of Hurricane Sandy striking New York City on 29 October 2012 and the resulting exogenous reduction in public transit access to particular neighbourhoods as a natural experiment to test for the effect of public transportation on employment outcomes. This study identifies a significant causal effect linking public transportation access to neighbourhood unemployment rates, particularly amongst subgroups dependent on public transit.},

For children growing up in low-income families, each year of childhood exposure to a one stan- dard deviation (std. dev.) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5{\%}. There is substantial variation in counties' causal effects even within metro areas. Counties with less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates tend to produce better outcomes for children in poor families. Boys' outcomes varymore across areas than girls' outcomes, and boys have especially negative outcomes in highly segregated areas. Areas that generate better outcomes have higher house prices on average, but our approach uncovers many “opportunity bargains”—places that generate good outcomes but are not very expensive.},

abstract = {Spatial inequality has drawn renewed scholarly interests and societal concerns. This paper reviews the literature on regional inequality, with a focus on spatiality of regional economic/income inequality, to make a timely contribution for a better understanding of the complexity and dynamics of spatial inequality. We find that existing theories disagree over temporal trends and underlying forces of regional inequality, and spatio-temporal models have been favored by economic geographers. It also shows that the research on regional inequality covers all continents of the world, including both developed and developing countries. The scope of research has also been broadened, expanding to household and environmental inequalities. The paper proposes components of spatiality of regional inequality, including scale, location, physical geography, place, space, spatial network, and spatial-temporal models. The paper also proposes areas for future research.},

We build an urban search-matching model incorporating informal labor, informal housing, and rural–urban migration.

This, in turn, pushes the expected income in the city downward and reduces incentives for rural workers to migrate. Surprisingly, rural–urban migration increases. This happens because greater decentralization relaxes the competition for land throughout the city, which reduces urban costs for all urban residents and effectively increases the expected income in the city.},

In the model, formal workers commute every day to the Central Business District (CBD) to work in formal firms. Informal workers choose their commuting frequency knowing that they either can work at home and save on commuting costs, or have a higher remuneration at the CBD but incur commuting costs. We demonstrate that the difference in urban costs between formal and informal workers is a mechanism through which improvements in accessibility lead to lower informality rates. Next, we use the model to compare the impact and efficiency of four policy options: a hiring-costs subsidy and a transport subsidy for either all workers, formal workers, or informal workers. We find that a transport subsidy targeted at informal workers is undesirable. We also find that a hiring-costs subsidy is superior to transport subsidies in reducing informality.},

abstract = {The modern U.S. living wage movement began in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1994. Since then, the movement has expanded to more than 140 cities and counties across the country. Living wage ordinances take many different forms, but all utilize various points of leverage in an effort to raise the minimum wage for workers. The most common form applies to public service contracts, but they can also cover economic development projects, city-owned property such as airports, colleges, direct city employees, tourist zones, and a small number even apply to all workers in a city. However, the movement has been limited in at least three ways. Living wage campaigns often focus on the “least common denominator” politics and so coalitions do not necessarily share values beyond the living wage. Second, as activists try to expand coverage through more expansive ordinances, the opposition has become more fierce and campaigns are harder to win. Finally, the local campaigns do not always include an analysis of global labor markets. Still, the movement continues, and we will likely see new efforts to raise state and federal minimum wages in the coming years.},

Brueckner and Zenou (1999) (hereafter BZ) argue that a model where migration equalizes expected wages between city and countryside may overlook another important force that equilibrates the process of rural-urban migration. This force is the migration-induced rise in the urban cost of living, which occurs principally through escalation of urban land rents as the city population expands. Land-rent escalation, which tends to limit rural-urban migration, provides an important additional force that may help determine city sizes in developing countries. The present paper provides a simpler alternative to BZ's analysis by assuming that urban residents smooth their income as they cycle between formal and informal employment. This allows migration decisions to be based on the expected wage, as in the usual HT framework, in a model that includes a land market. The analysis shows that this modified framework generates results slightly different from those of BZ.},

First, I analyze the inequality effects of these policies. I then perform two welfare economic analyses, the first based on summary measures of labor market conditions (total labor earnings, unemployment, inequality of labor incomes, and poverty rates) and the second based on dominance analysis in the labor market, in both cases assuming that the costs are borne elsewhere. The results of the welfare analyses are compared, and it is shown that TSENR unambiguously increases welfare in the labor market using both approaches, the other policies yield ambiguous results, and no policy is unambiguously welfare-decreasing. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper adds a land market to a standard Harris-Todaro framework. In the standard model, the equilibrating force that limits rural-urban migration is a decline in the probability of formal employment, which follows from enlargement of the informal sector. The key insight of the present paper, borrowed from Brueckner (1990) [Brueckner, J.K., 1990. Analyzing Third World urbanization: A model with empirical evidence. Economic Development and Cultural Change 38, 587-610], is that urban land-rent escalation provides an additional force that limits the extent of migration. The most striking implication of this modified model is that formal-sector growth may not lead to additional migration from rural areas. The reason is that, because of land-rent escalation, such growth may depress a migrant's expected utility despite the improved chance of obtaining a formal job. In the second part of the analysis, the efficiency-wage model is used to make wages and employment in the formal sector endogenous instead of fixed. While many comparative-static effects are ambiguous in this more-complex model, the role of the land market is basically unaffected.},

Whether these new connections crowd out or encourage educational investment is a central question. We examine the impacts on educational choices of 115,000 new roads built under India's flagship road construction program. We find that children stay in school longer and perform better on standardized exams. Treatment heterogeneity supports the predictions of a standard human capital investment model: enrollment increases are largest where nearby labor markets offer the highest returns to education and lowest where they imply high opportunity costs of schooling.},

I first use a geographic instrument to show that spatial competition substantially increases ­firm-specific property tax breaks.

In counterfactual exercises, restricting which levels of government can offer tax breaks has little effect on equilibrium business locations but lowers total exemptions by 30 percent. This suggests that local tax break competition primarily reduces taxes for mobile firms and is unlikely to substantially affect the efficiency of business location. (JEL H25, H71, H73, R32)},

abstract = {Migration and pollution are two of the de ning features of China's impressive growth performance over the last 30 years. In this paper we study the migration response to the dispersion of pollution across Chinese cities, and its consequences for productivity and welfare. We document a robust pattern in which college-educated workers respond more strongly to pollution than the unskilled by emigrating. Their greater sensitivity to air quality holds up in cross-sectional variation across cities, panel variation with city xed-e ects, in a regression discontinuity, and when instrumenting for pollution using power-plants upwind of cities, or with thermal inversions that trap pollution. Pollution therefore changes the spatial distribution of skilled and unskilled workers, which results in higher returns to skill in cities that the educated migrate away from. We quantify the loss in aggregate productivity and welfare due to this sorting by estimating a model of demand and supply of skilled and unskilled workers across Chinese cities. Reducing pol- lution increases GDP both by directly improving health and productivity, and indirectly by changing the spatial distribution of skilled and unskilled workers. Counterfactual si- mulations show that gains through the indirect spatial sorting channel are about as large as the direct health bene ts of clean air.},

And if history matters for the distri- bution, does it also matter for the total amount? This paper develops an empirically tractable theoretical framework that aims to provide answers to these questions. We de- rive parameter conditions, for arbitrary geographic scenarios, under which equilibrium transition paths are unique and yet steady states may nevertheless be non-unique | that is, where initial conditions ($\backslash$history") may determine long-run steady-state out- comes ($\backslash$path dependence"). We also derive analytical expressions, functions of the particular geography in question, that provide upper and lower bounds on the aggregate welfare level that can be sustained in any steady-state. We then estimate the model's parameters (which govern the strength of agglomeration externalities and trade and migration frictions), by focusing on moment conditions that are robust to potential equilibrium multiplicity, using spatial variation across US counties from 1800 to the present. Our simulations imply that the location of economic activity in the US today is highly sensitive to variations geographically local historical shocks, and the analyti- cal bounds suggest the possibility of larger historical shocks mattering in the long-run.},

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {Climatic variability and change is known to influence human migration patterns. Researchers increasingly see migration as one of a range of potential means by which populations may adapt to the future impacts of climate change. Modelling of climate change-related migration is a relatively new undertaking. This article provides a brief overview of current scholarly understanding of climate change-related migration processes, identifies recent developments and current challenges in modelling, and suggests opportunities for enhancing future modelling efforts. Given the lack of reliable global datasets on environmentally related migration, regional and sub-regional modelling of climate change effects on migration is where most developments are likely to emerge in the short-run. Such models, which can draw on a range of GIS-based and statistical approaches, at present make use of fairly general assumptions about migration behavior, and therefore best serve as gauges of potential trends and migration hotspots, and not as absolute predictors of future migrant numbers. Models will become increasingly sophisticated as scholarly understanding of underlying factors influencing migration behavior, such as risk perception, social networks, and labor market connections, is improved. Obtaining reliable data for use in such models will remain a significant challenge in coming years. International policymakers seeking to expand the predictive capacity of models are encouraged to use existing mechanisms such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to develop protocols and mechanisms for collecting and sharing reliable data on climate-related population movements. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We construct a simple theoretical model where, in a first step, climate shocks accelerate the transition from the traditional to the modern sector, leading rural workers to move to urban centres within national borders, while in a second step, downward pressures on wages due to the greater labour supply in cities push people to engage in international migration. To test this hypothesis, we exploit a rich panel dataset, displaying a representative picture of bilateral migration flows and climatic data across 222 countries for the period 1960–2000. Findings suggest that in the next few years the climate-induced growth rate of migrant stocks might be in a range between 8.6 per cent and 12.8 per cent, especially from developing countries, where the level of rural employment is more likely to be affected by climatic shocks.},

We model the long-term relationship (up to 45 years of projection) between demographic dynamics-particularly migration-driven by changes in the performance of the economy due to climate changes in the Northeast region of Brazil. The region is of particular relevance to the study of climate change impacts given its large human population (28{\%} of Brazil's population) and high levels of impoverishment, having an extensive semi-dry area which will be severely impacted by growing temperatures. Ultimately, the integrated model generates state- and municipal-level migration scenarios based on climate change impacts on the primary economic sectors and their articulations with other sectors. Results suggest that the predicted climate changes will impact severely the agriculture sector in the region, acting as a potential migration push factor to other regions in the country. Finally, we discuss how the increased vulnerability of some groups, particularly migrants, can be factored into Brazilian public policy and planning. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Applied to the Great Recession at the state level, the business cycle accounting exercise provides two main findings. First, for 40 out of 48 states the labor wedge played a primary role in accounting for the di↵erences between employment at the state level and employment at the aggregate level. Second, for 42 states the intertemporal wedge played a prominent role in accounting for the di↵erences between consumption at the state level and consumption at the aggregate level. These results suggest that models using regional variation to study the business cycle of the Great Recession would need mechanisms generating fluctuations in more than one wedge to account for relative fluctuations in employment and consumption of a given region; however, in principle, such mechanisms need not be di↵erent for di↵erent regions.},

This paper analyzes the impact of rainfall fluctuations during the gestational period on health at birth in the Brazilian semiarid, highlighting the role of water scarcity as a determinant of early life health. We find that negative rainfall shocks are robustly correlated with higher infant mortality, lower birth weight, and shorter gestation periods. Mortality effects are concentrated on intestinal infections and malnutrition, and are greatly minimized when the local public health infrastructure is sufficiently developed (municipality coverage of piped water and sanitation). We also find that effects are stronger during the fetal period (2nd trimester of gestation), for children born during the dry season, and for mortality immediately after birth. Our estimates suggest that expansions in public health infrastructure would be a cost-effective way of reducing the response of infant mortality to rainfall scarcity.},

We demonstrate that estimates using these “shift-share” instruments are inherently vulnerable to bias from dynamic adjustments to past shocks. To illustrate, we show that estimates of the partial equilibrium impact of immigration on wages employing a frequently-used shift-share instrument are unlikely to identify a causal effect. We propose a dynamic variant of the shift-share estimator that yields consistent and substantially more negative estimates than those using the conventional instrument. Our results are a cautionary tale for a large body of empirical work relying on shiftshare instruments for causal inference.},

This paper uses the construction of China's high speed rail (HSR) network as a natural experiment to test this claim. HSR connects major cities, that feature the nation's best universities, to secondary cities. Since bullet trains reduce cross-city commute times, they reduce the cost of face-to-face interactions between skilled workers who work in different cities. Using a data base listing research paper publication and citations, we document a complementarity effect between knowledge production and the transportation network. Co-authors' productivity rises and more new co-author pairs emerge when secondary cities are connected by bullet train to China's major cities.},

Using a panel of bilateral commuting flows, I estimate a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model to quantify the welfare benefits of urban rail transit and distinguish the benefits of reduced commuting frictions from other channels. The subway causes a 7{\%}-13{\%} increase in commuting between pairs of connected tracts; I select plausible control pairs using proposed subway and historical streetcar lines to identify this effect. The structural parameters of the model are also estimated and are identified using a novel strategy that interacts tract-specific labor demand shocks with the spatial configuration of the city. These parameters indicate people are relatively unresponsive to changes in local prices and characteristics, implying that the commuting response corresponds to a large utility gain. The welfare benefits by 2000 are significant: LA Metro Rail increases aggregate welfare by {\$}246 million annually. However, these benefits are only about one-third of annualized costs. While benefits did not outweigh costs by 2000, I employ more recent data to show that there are dynamic effects: Commuting continues to increase between connected locations.},

This paper offers an overview and synthesis of existing$\backslash$r$\backslash$nknowledge on the relationship between immigration and inequality, focusing on evidence$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfrom cross-city comparisons in the U.S. While some researchers have claimed that a$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncross-city research design is inherently flawed, I argue that the evidence from cross-city$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncomparisons is remarkably consistent with recent findings based on aggregate time$\backslash$r$\backslash$nseries data. In particular, cross-city and aggregate time series comparisons provide$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsupport for three key conclusions: (1) workers with below high school education are$\backslash$r$\backslash$nperfect substitutes for those with a high school education; (2) “high school equivalent”$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand “college equivalent” workers are imperfect substitutes, with an elasticity of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsubstitution on the order of 2; (3) within education groups, immigrants and natives are$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimperfect substitutes. Together these results imply that the average impacts of recent$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimmigrant inflows on the relative wages of U.S. natives are small. The effects on overall$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwage inequality (including natives and immigrants) are larger, reflecting the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nconcentration of immigrants in the tails of the skill distribution and higher residual$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninequality among immigrants than natives. Even so, immigration accounts for a small$\backslash$r$\backslash$nshare (5{\%}) of the increase in U.S. wage inequality between 1980 and 2000.},

We combine the cross-regional analysis of geographic, institutional, cultural, and human capital determinants of regional development with an examination of productivity in several thousand establishments located in these regions. To organize the discussion, we present a new model of regional development that introduces into a standard migration framework elements of both the Lucas (1978) model of the allocation of talent between entrepreneurship and work, and the Lucas (1988) model of human capital externalities. The evidence points to the paramount importance of human capital in accounting for regional differences in development, but also suggests from model estimation and calibration that entrepreneurial inputs and possibly human capital externalities help understand the data. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.

@article{Harris2014,
abstract = {This paper describes the construction of an updated gridded climate dataset (referred to as CRU TS3.10) from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the world's land areas. Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way. This gridded product will be publicly available, including the input station series (http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ and http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cru/). {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This paper studies the effect of India's rural public works program on rural-to-urban migration and urban labor markets. We find that seasonal migration from rural districts that implemented the program decreased relative to those that were selected to, but did not implement it. We use a gravity model and find that real wages rose faster in cities with higher predicted migration from program districts. Since most seasonal migrants work outside of their district, urban wage increases were not limited to program districts, and may have attracted migrants from nonprogram districts. Difference- in-differences may hence be biased. Structural estimates indeed suggest that migration decreased by 22{\%} in program districts, but also increased by 5{\%} in nonprogram districts. As a result, urban wages increased by only 0.5{\%}, against 4.1{\%} if the program had been implemented in all selected districts.},

This compositional change is specific to Miami and unrelated to the Boatlift. They also show that conflicting findings on the labor market effects of other important refugee waves are caused by spurious correlation in some analyses between the instrument and the endogenous variable, introduced by applying a common divisor to both. As a whole, the evidence from refugee waves reinforces the existing consensus that the impact of immigration on average native-born workers is small, and it fails to substantiate claims of large detrimental effects on workers with less than a high school education.},

abstract = {We present a high spatial resolution, multi-temporal climatology for the incidence of 20th century European drought. The climatology provides, for a given location or region, the time series of drought strength, the number, the mean duration, and the maximum duration of droughts of a given intensity, and the trend in drought incidence. The drought climatology is based on monthly standardized precipitation indices (SPIs) calculated on a 0.5° grid over the European region 35-70°N and 35°E-10°W at time scales of 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months for the period 1901-99. The standardized property facilitates the quantitative comparison of drought incidence at different locations and over different time scales. The standardization procedure (probability transformation) has been tested rigorously assuming normal, log-normal, and gamma statistics for precipitation. Near equivalence is demonstrated between the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and SPIs on time scales of 9 to 12 months. The mean number and duration by grid cell of extreme European drought events (SPI ≤ -2) on a time scale of 12 months is 6 ± 2 months and 27 ± 8 months respectively. The mean maximum drought duration is 48 ± 17 months. Trends in SPI and PDSI values indicate that the proportion of Europe experiencing extreme and/or moderate drought conditions has changed insignificantly during the 20th century. We hope the climatology will provide a useful resource for assessing both the regional vulnerability to drought and the seasonal predictability of the phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {A large literature exploits geographic variation in the concentration of immigrants to identify their impact on a variety of outcomes. To address the endogeneity of immigrants' location choices, the most commonly-used instrument interacts national inflows by country of origin with immigrants' past geographic distribution. We present evidence that estimates based on this "shift- share" instrument conflate the short- and long-run responses to immigration shocks. If the spatial distribution of immigrant inflows is stable over time, the instrument is likely to be correlated with ongoing responses to previous supply shocks. Estimates based on the conventional shift-share instrument are therefore unlikely to identify the short-run causal effect. We propose a "multiple instrumentation" procedure that isolates the spatial variation arising from changes in the country- of-origin composition at the national level and permits us to estimate separately the short- and long-run effects. Our results are a cautionary tale for a large body of empirical work, not just on immigration, that rely on shift-share instruments for causal inference.},

The current study investigates the effects of urban amenities on the settlement intentions of rural–urban migrants in China. We find that medical amenities have a significantly positive effect on rural–urban migrants' intentions. We also indicate that educational amenities and transportation services attract rural–urban migrants to settle in cities. Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneous effects of amenities on different cohorts by education and age. High- and low-skilled rural–urban migrants focus on transportation amenities, while young and middle–aged migrants are attracted by urban educational amenities. Results suggest that increasing access to urban amenities for rural–urban migrants and improving urban amenities enhance the willingness of rural–urban migrants to stay in cities.},

The new economics of labor migration theory provides background, positing that migration represents a household-level risk management strategy. We use data from the year 2000 Mexican census for rural localities and socioeconomic and state-level precipitation data provided by the Mexican National Institute for Statistics and Geography. Multilevel models assess the impact of rainfall change on household-level international out-migration while controlling for relevant sociodemographic and economic factors. A decrease in precipitation is significantly associated with U. S.-bound migration, but only for dry Mexican states. This finding suggests that programs and policies aimed at reducing Mexico-U. S. migration should seek to diminish the climate/weather vulnerability of rural Mexican households, for example by supporting sustainable irrigation systems and subsidizing drought-resistant crops. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization is an important characteristic of African development and yet the structural transformation debate focuses on agriculture's relative merits without also considering the benefits from urban agglomeration. As a result, African governments are often provided conflicting recommendations on the importance of rural agriculture or urban industry. We develop dynamic economywide models for Ethiopia and Uganda that capture both traditional aspects of the debate (growth linkages and foreign trade) and benefits from urbanization (internal migration and agglomeration effects). Simulations suggest that urban agglomeration is an important source of long-term growth and structural transformation, but that investing in cities does not greatly reduce national poverty over the short-term. In this regard, agricultural growth is more effective, albeit with slower national growth. Given these trade-offs, we conclude that, while urbanization's benefits argue against an "agro-fundamentalist" approach to African development, the short-term imperative of reducing poverty necessitates further agricultural investment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The crop-wise analysis shows that a 1 per cent decline in rice (wheat) yield leads to a nearly 2 per cent (1 per cent) increase in the rate of out-migration from a state. The district-level analysis shows larger magnitudes of estimated change in in-migration rates to relative changes in crop yields.

abstract = {There is growing international concern at the rise in the severity of impact and frequency of extreme environmental events, potentially as a manifestation of global environmental change. There is a widely held belief that this trend could be linked with a future rise in the migration or displacement of human populations. However, recent approaches to migration influenced by environmental change call into question the notion that migration can be ascribed in a singular way to particular environmental causes or events. This paper undertakes a systematic review of evidence on population movements associated with weather-related extreme events. The paper demonstrates that in the face of extreme environmental events, it is important to distinguish between three outcomes – migration, displacement, and immobility – each of which interact and respond to multiple drivers. It also proposes a further insight: that both those who move, and those who do not move, may find themselves trapped and vulnerable in the face of such extreme events. A review of evidence suggests that short-term displacement that goes hand-in-hand with loss of life, destruction of property and economic disruption poses significant risks not because it is environmental migration, but because it represents a failure of adaptation to environmental change.},

It is a blessing because the dyadic dimension of the data allows researchers to address a number of previously unanswered questions, but it is also a curse for the various analytical challenges it gives rise to. This paper presents the theoretical foundations of the estimation of gravity models of international migration, and the main difficulties that have to be tackled in the econometric analysis, such as the nature of migration data, how to account for multilateral resistance to migration or endogeneity.

abstract = {China strongly restricts rural-rural, urban-urban, and rural-urban migration. The result which this paper documents is a surplus of labor in agriculture. However, the paper argues that these restrictions also lead to insufficient agglomeration of economic activity within both rural industrial and urban areas, with resulting first order losses in GDP. For urban areas the paper estimates a city productivity relationship, based on city GDP numbers for 1990-97. The effects of access, educational attainment, FDI, and public infrastructure on productivity are estimated. Worker productivity is shown to be an inverted U-shape function of city employment level, with the peak point shifting out as industrial composition moves from manufacturing to services. As far as we know this is the first paper to actually estimate the relationship between output per worker and city scale, as it varies with industrial composition. The majority of Chinese cities are shown to be potentially undersized - below the lower bound on the 95{\%} confidence interval about the size where their output per worker peaks. The paper calculates the large gains from increased agglomeration in both the rural industrial and urban sectors. It also examines the effect of capital reallocations, where the rural sector is grossly undercapitalized. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {Roughly one-third of the rural population in developing countries lives in arid and semiarid regions, facing recurrent water scarcity. This is likely to become an even more common situation with climate change. This paper analyzes the impact of rainfall fluctuations during the gestational period on health at birth in the Brazilian semiarid, highlighting the role of water scarcity as a determinant of early life health. We find that negative rainfall shocks are robustly correlated with higher infant mortality, lower birth weight, and shorter gestation periods. Mortality effects are concentrated on intestinal infections and malnutrition, and are greatly minimized when the local public health infrastructure is sufficiently developed (municipality coverage of piped water and sanitation). We also find that effects are stronger during the fetal period (2nd trimester of gestation), for children born during the dry season, and for mortality immediately after birth. Our estimates suggest that expansions in public health infrastructure would be a cost-effective way of reducing the response of infant mortality to rainfall scarcity.},

The author revisits the question of wage impacts from such a supply shock, drawing on the cumulative insights of research on the economic impact of immigration. That literature shows that the wage impact must be measured by carefully matching the skills of the immigrants with those of the incumbent workforce. Given that at least 60{\%} of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article specifically examines the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis overturns the prior finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miami's wage structure. The wage of high school dropouts in Miami dropped dramatically, by 10 to 30{\%}, suggesting an elasticity of wages with respect to the number of workers between −0.5 and −1.5.},

abstract = {The canonical model for studying the impact of immigration is a partial equi-librium model that combines one or various types of labor with capital in a constant-returns-to-scale production function (for an early example, see Altonji and Card 1991). The implications of this model for how immigration affects wages and employment are straightforward and intuitive. An expansion of a certain type of labor will lead to a decrease in the wage of native labor of the same type, in absolute terms and relative to other types of labor—as well as an increase in the marginal productivity of capital. This model has led to the common view of immigra-tion being potentially harmful for individuals whose skills are most similar to those of immigrants, but possibly beneficial for those whose skills are different. However, when this canonical model is implemented through empirical models, some studies using this approach find a sizeable effect of immigration on wages of native workers, while others do not. For instance, while Card (2009) finds that immigration to the United States has only a minor effect on native wages, Borjas (2003) provides evidence for wages of natives being harmed by immigration, and Ottaviani and Peri (2012) report positive wage effects on natives. One reaction to these apparently contradictory find-ings has been to expand the theoretical framework in various ways. For example, one},

However, reliable and up-to-date information on their locations and development dynamics is scarce. Despite numerous studies, the task of delineating slum areas remains a challenge and no general agreement exists about the most suitable method for detecting or assessing detection performance. In this paper, standard computer vision methods–Bag of Visual Words framework and Speeded-Up Robust Features have been applied for image-based classification of slum and non-slum areas in Kalyan and Bangalore, India, using very high resolution RGB images. To delineate slum areas, image segmentation is performed as pixel-level classification for three classes: Slums, Built-up and Non-Built-up. For each of the three classes, image tiles were randomly selected using ground truth observations. A multi-class support vector machine classifier has been trained on 80{\%} of the tiles and the remaining 20{\%} were used for testing. The final image segmentation has been obtained by classification of every 10th pixel followed by a majority filtering assigning classes to all remaining pixels. The results demonstrate the ability of the method to map slums with very different visual characteristics in two very different Indian cities.},

Our data also indicate that subways cause cities to decentralize, although the effect is smaller than previously documented effects of highways on decentralization.

We assemble a granular database with program boundaries, historical maps, current land values, building heights, measures of land fragmentation, and a novel quality index of informal settlements based on Google Street View and field photos. Our research design compares KIP areas with historical slums that were never treated. Our findings are similar using a boundary discontinuity design. KIP areas today have 12{\%} lower land values and buildings with 1.6 fewer floors on average, implying aggregate impacts of US{\$}11 billion. Greater land fragmentation in KIP areas points towards the importance of land assembly costs as a barrier to formalization. These long-term costs need to be weighed against the benefits of the program. Overall, our findings suggest slum upgrading may be more cost effective for cities in early stages of urban development.},

In regions where cities are likely to be manufacturing centers (25{\%} of our sample), drier conditions increase urbanization and total urban incomes. There, urban migration provides an “escape” from negative agricultural moisture shocks. However, in the remaining market towns (75{\%} of our sample), cities just service agriculture. Reduced farm incomes from negative shocks reduce demand for urban services and derived demand for urban labor. There, drying has little impact on urbanization or total urban incomes.

abstract = {We present a microlevel study to simultaneously investigate the effects of variations in temperature and precipitation along with sudden natural disasters to infer their relative influence on migration that is likely permanent. The study is made possible by the availability of household panel data from Indonesia with an exceptional tracking rate combined with frequent occurrence of natural disasters and significant climatic variations, thus providing a quasi-experiment to examine the influence of environment on migration. Using data on 7,185 households followed over 15 y, we analyze whole-household, province-to-province migration, which allows us to understand the effects of environmental factors on permanent moves that may differ from temporary migration. The results suggest that permanent migration is influenced by climatic variations, whereas episodic disasters tend to have much smaller or no impact on such migration. In particular, temperature has a nonlinear effect on migration such that above 25°C, a rise in temperature is related to an increase in outmigration, potentially through its impact on economic conditions. We use these results to estimate the impact of projected temperature increases on future permanent migration. Though precipitation also has a similar non-linear effect on migration, the effect is smaller than that of temperature, underscoring the importance of using an expanded set of climatic factors as predictors of migration. These findings on the minimal influence of natural disasters and precipitation on permanent moves supplement previous findings on the significant role of these variables in promoting temporary migration.},

We hypothesise that, when exposed to such shocks and a consecutive crop yield reduction, rural households use migration as a risk management strategy. Our findings confirm that for an average household, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. However, this effect is significant only for households in the middle of wealth distribution, suggesting that the choice of migration as an adaptation strategy depends on initial endowment. What is more, the proposed mechanism applies to households whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, but is not important for diversified livelihoods.},

We limit our study to the Indian urban (non-agricultural) sector and study the characteristics of the household heads that belong to the informal sector (self-employed and informal wage workers) and the formal sector. We find that household heads that are less educated, come from poorer households, and/or are in lower social groups (castes and religions) are more likely to be in the informal sector. In addition, our results show strong evidence that the longer a rural migrant household head has been working in the urban areas, ceteris paribus, the more likely that individual has moved out of the informal wage sector. These results support the hypothesis that, for internal migrants, the informal wage labour market is a stepping stone to a secured life in the formal sector. JEL codes: 017; J15; J61; J42.},

The notion of labor market segmentation can be stylized most simply by maintaining that there are two labor market segments.

We investigate the consequences of climate-related natural disasters for long-term population mobility in rural Bangladesh, a region particularly vulnerable to environmental change, using longitudinal survey data from 1,700 households spanning a 15-y period. Multivariate event history models are used to estimate the effects of flooding and crop failures on local population mobility and long-distance migration while controlling for a large set of potential confounders at various scales. The results indicate that flooding has modest effects on mobility that are most visible at moderate intensities and for women and the poor. However, crop failures unrelated to flooding have strong effects on mobility in which households that are not directly affected but live in severely affected areas are the most likely to move. These results point toward an alternate paradigm of disaster-induced mobility that recognizes the significant barriers to migration for vulnerable households as well their substantial local adaptive capacity.},

To that end, we employ a spatial equilibrium model in which the climate shapes workers' locational choices through the usual amenity-value channel and the novel indirect channel via agriculture wages. Our simulations reveal that counterfactual migration rates are 5.9{\%} higher, and that nearly half a million more people migrate inter-regionally under future climate conditions. Furthermore, the Southeast, the most developed region, gains population and welfare, while the Northeast, one of the least developed regions, loses. Climate change, therefore, will likely exacerbate the country's existing regional inequalities.},

As a consequence the income of rural populations will change, and with it the incentives for people to remain in rural areas. Using data from 115 countries between 1960 and 2000, we analyze the effect of differential warming trends across countries on the probability of either migrating out of the country or from rural to urban areas. We find that higher temperatures in middle-income economies increased migration rates to urban areas and to other countries. In poor countries, higher temperatures reduced the probability of migration to cities and to other countries, consistently with the presence of severe liquidity constraints. In middle-income countries, migration represents an important margin of adjustment to global warming, potentially contributing to structural change and even increasing income per worker. Such a mechanism, however, does not seem to work in poor economies.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

These asymmetric migration responses are consistent with a simple model where rural-urban earnings differentials and liquidity constraints interact to determine rural-to-urban migration flows. We also confirm these temperature effects using country-level observations constructed by aggregating the grid cell level data. We project that expected warming in the next century will encourage further urbanization in middle-income countries such as Argentina, but it will slow down urban transition in poor countries like Malawi and Niger.},

abstract = {Growing evidence demonstrates that climatic conditions can have a profound impact on the functioning of modern human societies, but effects on economic activity appear inconsistent. Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries. In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature, while poor countries respond only linearly. Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human-natural systems and to anticipating the global impact of climate change. Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is non-linear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13°C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change, with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23{\%} by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.},

abstract = {The research presented here argues that identifying the impacts of rail transit on property values is not possible without estimates of both price gradients to transit stations as well as overall property value trends in transit neighborhoods. The latter may highlight a number of secondary impacts of rail transit on nuisance elements such as crime and parking as well as targeted public and private investment along rail-transit corridors. In order to estimate neighborhood property values, one must establish relevant control neighborhoods. In the case of Charlotte, North Carolina, the public planning and funding process provides information on proposed light rail-transit (LRT) corridors that were ultimately not selected as the first alignment in Charlotte's light rail transit system in 2000. Estimation incorporates a difference-in-difference estimator across a range of hedonic models. Preferred estimates highlight that LRT provides a neighborhood impact of 4.0{\%} for single-family properties and 11.3{\%} for condominiums sold within 1. mile of LRT stations. No neighborhood impacts are realized for commercial properties and estimated price gradients provide insignificant impacts across a number of models. Results suggest that LRT investment may be used more as an economic development tool for specific neighborhoods rather than a transportation amenity in cities like Charlotte, which contain sparser development patterns. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Employing high-precision satellite data, we identify objective variations in the inundations generated by a catastrophic typhoon in Vietnam and match them with household panel data before and after the shock. We find that, following a massive drop in income, households cope mainly through labor migration to urban areas. Households with settled migrants ex ante receive more remittances. Nonmigrant households react by sending new members away who then remit similar amounts than established migrants. This mechanism is most effective with long-distance migration, while local networks fail to provide insurance.},

abstract = {This dissertation comprises two papers that examine the effect of urban transportation systems on employment outcomes and traffic congestion. The first paper evaluates the labor market effects of subway systems on low-skilled workers. A model of labor supply predicts that this should improve search and employment outcomes. The empirical findings confirm that improved subway access increases low-skilled labor force participation. Related effects for light rail and bus service are much smaller. For low-skilled men without a car, a 10 percent expansion in subway, rail, and bus service increases labor force participation by 3.0, 0.3, and 0.3 percentage points, respectively. Improved subway service increases hourly wage, but has no significant effect on work hours and commuting time. These findings confirm that subway access increases travel speed and has potential to expand the geographic scope of workers' labor market.     The second paper investigates the effects of subway expansions on passenger miles traveled (PMT) in subways and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on roads in the US.

@article{Baum-Snow2005,
abstract = {FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL governments have spent more than {\$}25 billion to establish or expand rail transit infrastructure in sixteen major U.S. metro-politan areas between 1970 and 2000. Billions more have been invested to maintain and improve existing rail transit lines. Despite the significant infra-structure improvements associated with these investments, transit ridership has been declining rapidly. The fraction of metropolitan area commuters in the United States using public transit declined from 0.12 in 1970 to 0.06 in 2000. Furthermore, only in a few metropolitan areas has transit increased its share of the commuting market since 1970, and in none of these areas did transit garner more than 10 percent of the market in 2000. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which rail transit improvements have spurred new ridership and we provide some rough estimates of the value of these new commuting options. We demonstrate the importance of consid-ering heterogeneous responses of commuting mode choice both within and between metropolitan areas to the existence of new rail lines. For example, in each metropolitan area except Chicago, commuters living beyond ten kilo-meters of the city center and within two kilometers of a new rail transit line increased their transit use between 1970 and 2000. However, most metropol-itan areas saw declines in ridership within ten kilometers of the city center in areas near and far from new rail lines alike. Variation in metropolitan area structure is also key in determining whether new rail lines succeed at attract-ing riders. Rail transit is more likely to be successful in more densely popu-lated and centralized cities. Of the sixteen cities that significantly expanded their rail infrastructure after 1970, we find that Washington stands out as a place where rail transit investments have had relatively high returns. Finally, we find little evidence that significant ridership gains due to new rail lines continue to accrue more than a few years after construction is completed. Panel data at the census tract level allow us to evaluate the effects on rider-ship of new rail lines by making two types of comparisons. Exploitation of within metropolitan area variation in access allows for comparison of areas of each city that received new rail transit to equivalent areas that did not. Time series variation in transit access allows for comparison of the same census tract in each city over time. This difference-in-difference type comparison ultimately identifies our estimates of ridership gains as a result of new rail transit. Census data on commuting times and the number of rail, bus, and car commuters allow us to roughly calculate the number of commuting hours saved as a result of new rail transit construction. We develop a simple theoretical model that provides intuition about the spatial patterns in commuting mode choice adjustments that one may expect to see as result of new rail transit infrastructure. The implications of the model motivate the specifications used in public transit use regressions. These regres-sions incorporate potentially heterogeneous responses of public transit use to new rail infrastructure as a function of the year the system was built, distance to the city center, and physical structure of the metropolitan area as a whole. These regressions form the core empirical contribution of this paper. We use the regression estimates to evaluate the extent to which new rail transit causes people to change commuting modes, allowing us to roughly quantify the wel-fare benefits of recently constructed rail lines and to make some predictions about the likely success or failure of rail transit construction projects currently underway in several U.S. cities. Our study builds on earlier research investigating the consequences of rail transit investments. In a previous paper, we document that transit ridership saw less than average declines near new rail lines constructed in five U.S. cities during the 1980s. 1 On the other hand, metropolitan areas have been decentralizing such that existing transit infrastructure facilitates access to a smaller fraction of residents and employment. 2 This is reflected in falling 2 Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs: 2005},

Using a panel of bilateral commuting flows, I estimate a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model to quantify the welfare benefits of urban rail transit and distinguish the benefits of reduced commuting frictions from other channels. The subway causes a 7{\%}-13{\%} increase in commuting between pairs of connected tracts; I select plausible control pairs using proposed subway and historical streetcar lines to identify this effect. The structural parameters of the model are also estimated and are identified using a novel strategy that interacts tract-specific labor demand shocks with the spatial configuration of the city. These parameters indicate people are relatively unresponsive to changes in local prices and characteristics, implying that the commuting response corresponds to a large utility gain. The welfare benefits by 2000 are significant: LA Metro Rail increases aggregate welfare by {\$}246 million annually. However, these benefits are only about one-third of annualized costs. While benefits did not outweigh costs by 2000, I employ more recent data to show that there are dynamic effects: Commuting continues to increase between connected locations.},

We find that in all but the most urban municipalities, allocation of larger refugee shares between electoral cycles leads to an increase in the vote share for right-leaning parties with an anti-immigration agenda, and we show large differences in voters' responses to refugee allocation according to pre-policy municipal characteristics. However, in the largest and urban municipalities, refugee allocation has—if anything—the opposite effect on vote shares for anti-immigration parties. This coincides with a sharp divide in attitudes to refugees between urban and rural populations, which may be partly explained by distinctive interactions between natives and those with different background in cities and rural areas. Refugee allocation also has a large impact on the anti-immigration parties' choice of where to stand for municipal election, and we provide some evidence that it influences voter turnout.},

To address this question, we develop a general equilibrium model featuring two skill types, search frictions, wage bargaining, and a welfare state that redistributes income through unemployment benefits and the provision of public goods. Our quantitative analysis suggests that, in all 20 countries studied, immigration attenuates the effects of search frictions. The resulting gains tend to outweigh the welfare costs of redistribution. Immigration has increased native welfare in almost all countries. In two-thirds of countries, both high- and low-skilled natives have benefited from the presence of immigrants, contrary to what models without search frictions or redistribution predict. Average total welfare gains from migration are 1.25{\%} and 1.00{\%} for high- and low-skilled natives, respectively.},

The main task is to identify the microeconomic underpinnings of centripetal forces, which lead to the concentration of economic activities, and centrifugal forces, which bring about the dispersion of economic activities at the regional and urban levels. Transportation matters at both scales, but in a different way. The emphasis is on the interregional flows of goods and passenger trips at the regional level and on individual commuting at the urban level.},

abstract = {Numerous evaluations of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs show positive short-term impacts, but there is only limited evidence on whether these benefits translate into sustained longer-term gains. This paper uses the municipal-level randomized assignment of a CCT program implemented for 5 years in Honduras to estimate long-term effects 13 years after program start. We estimate ITT effects using individual-level data from the population census, which allows assignment of individuals to their municipality of birth, thereby circumventing migration selection concerns. We find positive and robust impacts on educational outcomes for cohorts of a very wide age range, demonstrating that both early childhood exposure to the nutrition and health components of the CCT, as well as exposure during school-going ages to the educational components, led to sustained increases in human capital. These include increases in secondary school completion rates and the probability of reaching university studies of more than 50 percent for those exposed at school-going ages. Educational gains are, however, much more limited for indigenous children. Finally, exposure to the CCT more than doubled the probability of international migration of young men, from 3 to 7 percentage points, while other labor market results are inconclusive.

Tests based on commonly used standard errors with 5{\%} nominal significance level reject the null of no effect in up to 55{\%} of the placebo samples. We use a stylized economic model to show that this overrejection problem arises because regression residuals are correlated across regions with similar sectoral shares, independent of their geographic location. We derive novel inference methods that are valid under arbitrary cross-regional correlation in the regression residuals. We show using popular applications of shift-share designs that our methods may lead to substantially wider confidence intervals in practice.},

Under plausible assumptions, a one standard deviation improvement in uncongested speed creates much more mobility than optimal congestion pricing. Denser and more populated cities are slower, only in part because of congestion. Urban economic development is correlated with better (uncongested and overall) mobility despite worse congestion.},

Nonlinear reduced form estimates of the model using U.S. Census data document that positive labor demand shocks increase population more than negative shocks reduce population, this asymmetry is larger for low-skill workers, and such an asymmetry is absent for wages, housing values, and rental prices. GMM estimates of the full model suggest that the comparative immo-bility of low-skill workers is not due to higher mobility costs per se, but rather a lower incidence of adverse labor demand shocks.},

Second, the paper tests for the existence of organizational agglomeration economies of the kind studied qualitatively by Saxenian (1994).

The existing literature has found deconcentration (convergence) of employment across urban areas. Cities only cover a small part of the U.S. though. Using county data, our results indicate that deconcentration is limited to the upper tail of the distribution. The overall picture is one of increasing concentration (divergence). While this seemingly contradicts the well documented deconcentration in manufacturing, we show that these aggregate employment dynamics are driven by services. Non-service sectors - such as manufacturing and farming - are indeed becoming more equally spread across space, but services are becoming increasingly concentrated. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To understand the joint determination of migration and risk sharing I study a dynamic model of risk sharing with limited commitment frictions and endogenous temporary migration. First, I characterize the model. I demonstrate theoretically how migration may decrease risk sharing. I decompose the welfare effect of migration into the change in income and the change in the endogenous structure of insurance. I then show how risk sharing alters the returns to migration. Second, I structurally estimate the model using the new (2001-2004) ICRISAT panel from rural India. The estimation yields: (1) risk sharing reduces migration by 60{\%}; (2) migration reduces risk sharing by 23{\%}; (3) contrasting endogenous to exogenous risk sharing, the consumption-equivalent gain from migration is 7{\%} lower. Third, I introduce a rural employment scheme. The policy reduces migration and decreases risk sharing. The welfare gain of the policy is 50-65{\%} lower after household risk sharing and migration responses are considered.},

Using geocoded high-resolution data, the analysis is focused on exogenously determined within-city squares (‘neighbourhoods') of 1 km2. The analysis confirms a city-wide employment density–wage elasticity and an economically significant density–wage elasticity at the neighbourhood level that attenuate sharply with distance. Panel estimates over 20 years suggest a neighbourhood density–wage elasticity of about 3{\%}, while the city-wide elasticity is about 1{\%}. It is argued that the neighbourhood level is more prone to capture learning, e.g. through knowledge and information spillovers. This interpretation is supported by (1) significantly larger neighbourhood elasticities for university educated workers and (2) sharper attenuation with distance of the effect for such workers.},

abstract = {India is predominantly a rural country with two third population and 70{\%} workforce residing in rural areas. Rural economy constitutes 46 per cent of national income. Despite the rise of urbanisation more than half of India‟s population is projected to be rural by 2050. Thus growth and development of rural economy and population are a key to overall growth and inclusive development of the country. Traditionally, agriculture is the prime sector of rural economy and rural employment. The transition in composition of output and occupation from agriculture to more productive non-farm sectors is considered as an important source of economic growth and transformation in rural and total economy. However, no serious attempt has been made to analyse and understand the transition in India‟s rural economy. Economic studies on rural India have focused mainly on changes in rural employment, by gender and at broad sectoral aggregation between agriculture and non agriculture. The present study examines long term changes in (i) sectoral composition of rural output and employment, (ii) their relationships and implications for output growth and employment and (iii) income inequalities across sectors and between rural and urban sectors. The findings of the study are used to suggest strategy for future development of India‟s rural economy. The study analyses changes in rural economy and employment during the last forty years covering the period 1970-71 to 2011-12. Sector, and gender wise information on distribution of household members across economic activities and those not in workforce was taken from the Unit Level data available in various Quinquennium rounds of NSSO on Employment and Unemployment. Sector wise output data for the corresponding years was taken from the National Accounts Statistics of CSO. The study highlights the profound changes experienced by India‟s rural economy which have not been reckoned. Contrary to the common perception about predominance of agriculture in rural economy, about two third of rural income is now generated in non agricultural activities. Similarly, it looks amazing to find that more than half of the value added in manufacturing sector in India is contributed by rural areas. However, the impressive growth of non agricultural sector in rural India has not brought significant employment gains or reduction in disparity in worker productivity. This underlines the need for a new approach to direct the transition of rural economy.},

abstract = {This paper uses 2000 Census data to estimate the relationship of agglomeration and proximity to human capital to wages. The paper takes a geographic approach, and focuses on the attenuation of agglomeration and human capital effects. Differencing and instrumental variable methods are employed to address endogeneity in the wage-agglomeration relationship and also to deal with measurement error in our agglomeration and human capital variables. Three key results are obtained. First, the spatial concentration of employment within five miles is positively related to wage. Second, the benefits of spatial concentration are driven by proximity to college educated workers, an instance of human capital spillovers. Third, these effects attenuate sharply with distance. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Moving beyond the coarse rural-urban distinction, we then focus on the continuum of locations in an economy and describe how the patterns of convergence and divergence change with development. As we discuss, these spatial dynamics often mask important differences across sectors. We then turn our attention to the right tail of the distribution, the urban sector. We analyze how the urban hierarchy has changed over time in developed countries and more recently in developing countries. The chapter reviews both the empirical evidence and the theoretical models that can account for what we observe in the data. When discussing the stylized facts on geography and development, we draw on empirical evidence from both the historical evolution of today's developed economies and comparisons between today's developed and developing economies.},

While historical experience ofdeveloped countries is reviewed, today's rapid urbanization in developing countries of- fers an intense set of challenges. Rapid urbanization requires massive population move- ments and enormous local and inter-city infrastructure investments in a modern context of heavy government interventions in economies. This context raises under-researched issues, discussed in the second part of the paper. First concerns the spatial form of development. How much development should be focused in mega-cities, or huge urban clusters, as opposed to being more spatially dispersed, a critical question facing China and India today? How do we conceptualize and measure both the benefits and costs of increased urban concentration; and how are they linked to a country's evolving national industrial composition? Second, what is the evolution of spatial income inequality under massive rural-urban migration? Is inequality heightened today relative to the past by national government policies which “favor” certain cities and regions and by local gov- ernment policies in those cities that may try to deflect migrants by offering them poor living conditions?},

abstract = {This paper investigates the urbanization of the Indian manufacturing sector by combining enterprise data from formal and informal sectors. We find that plants in the formal sector are moving away from urban and into rural locations, while the informal sector is moving from rural to urban locations. While the secular trend for India‘s manufacturing urbanization has slowed down, the localized importance of education and infrastructure have not. Our results suggest that districts with better education and infrastructure have experienced a faster pace of urbanization, although higher urban-rural cost ratios cause movement out of urban areas. This process is associated with improvements in the spatial allocation of plants across urban and rural locations. Spatial location of plants has implications for policy on investments in education, infrastructure, and the livability of cities. The high share of urbanization occurring in the informal sector suggests that urbanization policies that contain inclusionary approaches may be more successful in promoting local development and managing its strains than those focused only on the formal sector.},

Rural areas benefit when the growth 'spreads' to the hinterlands, especially within daily commuting distance.

This study examines spread vs. backwash, as separate from long-run, distance-from-urban-center trend effects, using a novel Canadian GIS database.

This follows from assessing the relationship between poverty and remoteness as well as labour supply responses. Higher rural poverty does not appear to be a simple result of the poor self-selecting to live in remote areas. The results suggest that place-based anti-poverty policies may be beneficial.},

Residential population density functions are estimated using census tract level data and cubic spline regression methods. Comparisons of 1980 and 1990 density profiles indicate that population decentralization accompanied metropolitan growth during the 1980s. This redistribution was limited, however, to rural tracts at the urban fringe. Popula-tion densities were stable or declined in tracts more distant from the nodal center. Thus, backwash ef-fects were evident in most rural areas in the eco-nomic regions' hinterlands. (JEL R11)},

abstract = {One of the most dramatic economic transformations of the past century has been the entry of women into the labor force. While many theories explain why this change took place, we investigate the process of transition itself. We argue that local information transmission generates changes in participation that are geographically heterogeneous, locally correlated, and smooth in the aggregate, just like those observed in our data. In our model, women learn about the effects of maternal employment on children by observing nearby employed women. When few women participate in the labor force, data are scarce and participation rises slowly. As information accumulates in some regions, the effects of maternal employment become less uncertain and more women in that region participate. Learning accelerates, labor force participation rises faster, and regional participation rates diverge. Eventually, information diffuses throughout the economy, beliefs converge to the truth, participation flattens out, and regions become more similar again. To investigate the empirical relevance of our theory, we use a new county-level data set to compare our calibrated model to the time series and geographic patterns of participation.},

The paper discusses the implications of these findings in relation to the construction of urban economic growth zones in Central China as an important strategy of Central Rise.},

abstract = {Transport costs are widely considered an important barrier to local economic activity but their impact in developing countries is not well-studied. This paper investigates the role of inter-city transport costs in determining the income of Sub-Saharan African cities, using two new data sources. Specifically, it asks how important access to a large port city is for the income of hinterland cities in 15 countries. Satellite data on lights at night proxy for city economic activity, and shortest routes between cities are calculated using new road network data. Cost per unit of distance is identified by world oil prices. The results show that an oil price increase of the magnitude experienced between 2002 and 2008 induces the income of cities near a major port to increase by 6 percent relative to otherwise identical cities 500 kilometers farther away. Cities connected to the port by paved roads are chiefly affected by transport costs to the port, while cities connected to the port by unpaved roads are more affected by connections to secondary centers. These are important findings for economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa since the majority of its population growth over the next few decades is expected to be in urban areas.},

We show that, for both whites and nonwhites, higher (time) distance to jobs leads to lower search effort. Because of different transport modes, we also show that, at exactly the same (time) distance to jobs, white unemployed workers search more intensively than nonwhites because it is less costly for them to gather information about jobs. We then test this model using English sub-regional data. We find that, for each race, indeed, living in areas where distance to jobs is higher yields the unemployed to search less than in areas with better job access. We also find that having access to a car increases search intensity for both whites and nonwhites. Finally, closing the racial gap in car access and distance to jobs would considerably narrow the difference in search intensities between whites and nonwhites. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Our analysis is based on a spatial job search framework that shows the importance of dissociating the role of travel time from physical distance in unemployment duration. The contribution of our study also stems from the development of skill-specific accessibility measures that take into account the spatial distribution of labor supply and demand. Our results show that physical distance and competition among searchers must be controlled for in order to understand the significant role of job access (measured in terms of travel time) in unemployment duration. Second, improvements in access raise the probability that persons living in urban fringes and rural areas will become employed. Third, for workers living in large urban centers, the relationship between location and unemployment duration is insignificant. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, because job seekers are close enough to vacancies on average, this distaste for distance is fairly inconsequential: our search and matching model predicts that relocating job seekers to minimize unemployment would decrease unemployment by only 5.3 percent.

Using an identification strategy that exploits the staggered implementation of women police stations across cities and nationally representative data on various measures of crime and deterrence, we find that the opening of police stations increased reported crime against women by 22 percent. This is due to increases in reports of female kidnappings and domestic violence. In contrast, reports of gender-specific mortality, self-reported intimate-partner violence and other non-gender specific crimes remain unchanged. We also show that victims move away from reporting crimes in general stations and that self-reported use of support services increased in affected areas. The implementation of women police stations also led to marginal improvements in measures of police deterrence such as arrest rates.},

The GCL specimens recovered from the field after 3 years had a hydraulic conductivity with respect to water that was approximately 30{\%} less than that of the GCL specimens subjected to 12 initial freeze-thaw cycles in the laboratory, suggesting that the laboratory conditions are more severe than field conditions. The combined effects of both the freeze-thaw cycles and Jet A-1 permeation increased the permeability. This increase is attributed to the creation of macropores in the GCL due to freezing and to an expansion of free-pore space due to contraction of the double layer caused by permeation of Jet A-1. Although there was an increase in permeability due to the combined effect of freeze-thaw and permeation by Jet A-1, the effect was relatively small and the results suggest that the GCL continued to exhibit good performance as a hydraulic barrier when subject to extreme climatic conditions and hydrocarbons both in the laboratory and in the field. {\textcopyright} 2006 ASCE.},

abstract = {Economic models of migration recognize that potential changes in income are an important factor in the decision to change geographic location within a country's borders. For married couples, gains need not occur for both spouses, and ‘tied movers' may on average see their relative earnings fall as a result of internal migration. Previous research suggesting that wives appear on average to be tied movers primarily dates back to the 1970s. Examining data from the 1990s, I find a result similar to this earlier research, with wives losing on average about 20{\%} of their pre-migration earnings. Much of this decline is associated with a decline in work hours for wives. The effect seems to be short-lived, not clearly persisting into the second year following migration.},

The goal of this paper is to assess the implications of joint location constraints on the migration patterns, labor market outcomes, and marital stability of men and women. A model of household migration decisions in a dynamic framework with intra-household bargaining is devel-oped and estimated using the PSID. Results show that family ties hinder mobility and wage growth. Without family ties 25 percent of men and 23 percent of women move, whereas when married only 18 percent move. Without family ties average male wages increase by 10 percent and average fe-male wages increase by 3 percent, compared to when they are married. Also, without location ties divorce rates fall from 24 to 16 percent.},

The empirical tests show that gender neutral family migration cannot be rejected against the alternative of husband centered migration. Couples are more likely to migrate if household earnings potential is disproportionally due to one partner, and families react equally strongly to a male and a female relative advantage in educational earnings potential. These results are driven by households with a strong relative advantage to one of the partners while results are less clear for small dissimilarities within the couple, suggesting that gender identity norms may play a role when the opportunity costs of adhering to them are small.},

abstract = {Is there a causal connection between house prices and labor force participation of married women? The simple correlation between house prices and married women's labor force participation across U.S. metro areas is positive. Plausible, informal arguments have been advanced to support causation in either direction: prices raising participation (negative income effects of higher house prices lead more married women to work) or participation raising prices (richer two-earner households bid up the price of scarce housing). I construct an equilibrium model of location, labor supply and real estate (land) prices within a metro area which predicts that (1) metro areas with exogenously less buildable land will have higher house prices and more labor force participation of married women, while (2) metro areas with married women exogenously more prone to work will have higher house prices. Using geographic instruments for housing supply, I find little evidence of a positive effect of house prices on married women's labor force participation, but a somewhat greater possibility that house prices raise their earnings. Likewise, an instrument for married women's labor supply reveals no consistent significant causal effect of two earner households on housing prices, although the possibility of a positive effect cannot be ruled out. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {The author examines the historical record for the US since 1890 and data on approximately 100 countries to establish the relationship between women's labor force participation and economic development. She finds that the labor force participation rate of married women first declines and then rises as countries develop. This U shape is observed both across the process of economic development and through the histories of currently advanced economies. The initial decline in the participation rate is due to the movement of production from the household, family farm, and small business to the wider market in which women are less involved, and to a strong income effect. At some point, however, the income effect weakens and the substitution effect strengthens. This paper explores why the change takes place and why the U-shaped pattern reflecting the course of events exists. The relationship between female education and economic development is one reason for the U-shaped female labor force participation rate function. At low levels of development, access to and levels of education increase for males far more than for females. Incomes rise, with the income effect upon female labor supply serving to lower female participation. The norm against women working in manufacturing reinforces the income effect. As incomes increase even higher, educational resources are freed and females receive more education. The stigma effect against women's work is eliminated as women subsequently take jobs in the white-collar sector, and the substitution effect increases. With greater education for women and a larger white-collar sector, the income effect falls because more families no longer face the stigma effect of manufacturing work. The U curve is thereby explained.},

abstract = {This chapter presents a survey on female labor supply. The chapter surveys theoretical and empirical work on the labor supply of women, with special reference to women in Western economies, primarily the United States, in modern times. The behavior of female labor supply has important implications for many other phenomena, including marriage, fertility, divorce, the distribution of family earnings and male-female wage differentials. The labor supply of women is also of interest, because of the technical questions it poses. For example, because many women do not work, corner solutions are at least potentially a very important issue in both the theoretical and empirical analysis of female labor supply, even though in other contexts (for example, studies of consumer demand) corner solutions are often ignored. The chapter presents some “stylized facts” about female labor supply, and then discusses a number of theoretical models of special interest for understanding female labor supply. After considering empirical studies of the labor supply of women, the chapter concludes with some suggestions for future research. The chapter discusses major trends and cyclical patterns in time-series data, and then examines cross-sectional phenomena.},

Our theoretical model predicts that a shift in the supply of female workers increases gender wage inequality when men and women are imperfect substitute in production. Our structural estimate shows an imperfect substituability between men and women workers of similar education and experience. Our econometric analysis shows that a 10{\%} increase in immigrant female labor supply relative to immigrant male labor supply in a given education-experience group lowers the relative earnings of female native workers of that group by 4{\%}. We finally use a structural model to account for the cross-group effects induced by immigration and show that the rise in the relative number of female immigrants has decreased the relative wage of female native workers, thereby contributing to a widening native gender wage gap.},

This contrasts starkly with the experience of college-educated women: their probability of working in these types of jobs rose, despite a much larger increase in the supply of educated women relative to men during this period. We study a flexible neoclassical model of the labor market that allows us to shed light on the key forces capable of rationalizing these findings. The model indicates that one key channel is a greater increase in the demand for female-oriented skills in cognitive/high-wage occupations relative to other occupations. Using occupational task-level data, we find evidence that this relative increase in the demand for female skills is due to an increasing importance of social skills within such occupations. We find a strong and robust relationship between the change in the female share of employment and the importance of social skills in an occupation over time.},

Despite the widespread implementation of subsidies, there are virtually no quantitative assessments of their distributional incidence, making it impossible to determine if these policy instruments are pro‐poor.

abstract = {Using information from 10-K filings of public firms, we identify economic connections among U.S. states. At the firm level, we document excess comovement in returns and liquidity of firms headquartered in economically connected states. At the aggregate level, the economic connections create spillover effects whereby economic shocks in a state affect its connected states and the U.S. economy. For example, a 1{\%} production shock in California is related to a 6.71{\%} change in annual U.S. GDP growth, relative to the average GDP growth. Collectively, the geographic network of public firms facilitates the propagation of local shocks across the U.S. economy. },

We show that, for both whites and nonwhites, higher (time) distance to jobs leads to lower search effort. Because of different transport modes, we also show that, at exactly the same (time) distance to jobs, white unemployed workers search more intensively than nonwhites because it is less costly for them to gather information about jobs. We then test this model using English sub-regional data. We find that, for each race, indeed, living in areas where distance to jobs is higher yields the unemployed to search less than in areas with better job access. We also find that having access to a car increases search intensity for both whites and nonwhites. Finally, closing the racial gap in car access and distance to jobs would considerably narrow the difference in search intensities between whites and nonwhites. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {One of the unanswered questions in the field of urban economics is to which extent subsidies to public transit are justified. We examine one of the main benefits of public transit, a reduction in car congestion externalities, the so-called congestion relief benefit, using quasi-natural experimental data on citywide public transit strikes for Rotterdam, a city with mild congestion levels. On weekdays, a strike induces travel times to increase only marginally on the highway ring road (0.017. min/km) but substantially on inner city roads (0.224. min/km). During rush hour, the strike effect is much more pronounced. The congestion relief benefit of public transit is substantial, equivalent to about 80{\%} of the public transit subsidy. We demonstrate that during weekends, travel time does not change noticeably due to strikes. Furthermore, we show that public transit strikes induce similar increases in number of cyclists as number of car travelers suggesting that bicycling-promoting policies to reduce car congestion externalities might be attractive in combination with first-best congestion pricing.},

Theoretically, Uber's effect on transit is ambiguous: while Uber is an alternative mode of travel, it can also increase the reach and flexibility of public transit's fixed-route, fixed-schedule service. We estimate the effect of Uber on public transit ridership using a difference-in-differences design that exploits variation across U.S. metropolitan areas in both the intensity of Uber penetration and the timing of Uber entry. We find that Uber is a complement for the average transit agency, increasing ridership by five percent after two years. This average effect masks considerable heterogeneity, with Uber increasing ridership more in larger cities and for smaller transit agencies.},

We implement it for road travel in the city of Bogot{\'{a}} using information from a travel survey and counterfactual travel data generated from Google Maps. For the supply of travel, we find that the elasticity of the time cost of travel per unit of distance with respect to the number of travelers is on average about 0.06. It is close to zero at low levels of traffic, then reaches a maximum magnitude of about 0.20 as traffic builds up and becomes small again at high levels of traffic. This finding is in sharp contrast with extant results for specific road segments. We explain it by the existence of local streets which remain relatively uncongested and put a floor on the time cost of travel. On the demand side, we estimate an elasticity of the number of travelers with respect to the time cost of travel of 0.40. Although road travel is costly in Bogot{\'{a}}, these findings imply a small daily deadweight loss from congestion, equal to less than 1{\%} of a day's wage.},

A model in which localized industry-specific spillovers, natural advantages, and pure random chance all contribute to geographic concentration is used to develop a test for whether observed levels of concentration are greater than would be expected to arise randomly and to motivate new indices of geographic concentration and of coagglomeration. The proposed indices control for differences in the size distribution of plants and for differences in the size of the geographic areas for which data are available. As a consequence, comparisons of the degree of geographic concentration across industries can be made with more confidence. Our empirical results provide a strong reaffirmation of the previous wisdom in that we find almost all industries to be somewhat localized. In many industries, however, the degree of localization is slight. We explore the nature of agglomerative forces in describing patterns of concentration, the geographic scope of localization, and the coagglomeration of related industries and of industries with strong upstream-downstream ties.},

In contrast to previous studies, our approach allows us to assess the statistical significance of departures from randomness. In addition, we treat space as continuous instead of using an arbitrary collection of geographical units. This avoids problems relating to scale and borders. We apply these tests to an exhaustive U.K. data-set. For four-digit industries, we find that (i) 52{\%} of them are localized at a 5{\%} confidence level, (ii) localization mostly takes place at small scales below 50 km, (iii) the degree of localization is very skewed, and (iv) industries follow broad sectoral patterns with respect to localization. Depending on the industry, smaller establishments can be the main drivers of both localization and dispersion. Three-digit sectors show similar patterns of localization at small scales as well as a tendency to localize at medium scales.},

Using a unique worldwide plant-level dataset that reports detailed location, ownership, and operation information for plants in over 100 countries, we construct a spatially continuous index of agglomeration and analyze the different patterns underlying the global economic geography of multinational and non-multinational firms. We present new stylized facts that suggest that the offshore clusters of multinationals are not a simple reflection of domestic industrial clusters. Agglomeration economies including technology diffusion and capital-good market externality play a more important role in the offshore agglomeration of multinationals than the agglomeration of domestic firms. These findings remain robust when we explore the process of agglomeration.},

Our data also indicate that subways cause cities to decentralize, although the effect is smaller than previously documented effects of highways on decentralization.

We find that particulate concentrations drop by about 4{\%} in a 10km radius disk surrounding a city center during the year following a subway system opening. This reduction in particulates is larger nearer the city center, but extends over the whole metropolitan area. It persists over the longest time horizon that we can measure with our data, about eight years, although these estimates are less reliable further from the subway opening date. Our results also point to decreasing returns to subway expansions, both in terms of particulate reduction and ridership. Using estimates from the literature on the relationship between particulates and infant mortality suggests that each subway system provides an external mortality benefit of about {\$}21m per year. This external benefit is about {\$}594m per system per year if we consider mortality reduction effects for all city residents rather than just infants. Although available subway capital costs are crude, the estimated external mortality effects represent a significant fraction of construction costs.},

abstract = {This paper examines the impact of perceived risk of street harassment on women's human capital attainment. I assemble a unique dataset that combines information on 4,000 students at the University of Delhi from a survey that I designed and conducted, a mapping of the potential travel routes to all colleges in the students' choice set using an algorithm I developed in Google Maps, and crowd-sourced mobile application safety data. Using a random utility framework, I estimate that women are willing to choose a college in the bottom half of the quality distribution over a college in the top quintile for a route that is perceived to be one standard deviation (SD) safer. Alternatively, women are willing to spend an additional INR 18,800 (USD 290) per year, relative to men, for a route that is one SD safer – an amount equal to double the average annual college tuition. These findings have implications for other economic decisions made by women. For example, it could help explain the puzzle of low female labor force participation in India.},

abstract = {Bus rapid transit (BRT) is a popular mode for government investment in public infrastructure, particularly in developing countries where capital resources are scarce. Enthusiastic evaluations of BRT systems worldwide are perhaps premature given that most such systems have been operational for only a short time. Further, little research on BRT systems from the user perspective is evident in the literature. The latter is problematic because one justification for government investment in BRT is the social benefit such systems bestow on groups who are traditionally without access to private modes of transportation. In order to explore the purported social benefits of a BRT system two series of multiple logistic regression models are fit. The first uses disaggregate data from inside a BRT service area and the second uses disaggregate data from inside and from outside a BRT service area. The rider and the commuter data sources, respectively, help to understand who benefits from the new Metro Bus System (MBS) in Lahore and how. To that end, descriptive results show that women are less representative of riders and of commuters, but inferential results show that females are more likely to commute via the MBS. In addition, usage patterns show that females are more habitual users and that they benefit greatly from the fare subsidy. Finally, efforts to further integrate the MBS with the greater public transportation network in Lahore will help to mitigate the monetary and the temporal costs of MBS usage which more so affect females.},

abstract = {The textbook policy response to traffic externalities is congestion pricing. However, quanti-fying the welfare consequences of pricing policies requires detailed knowledge of commuter pref-erences and of the road technology. I study the peak-hour traffic congestion equilibrium using rich travel behavior data and a field experiment grounded in theory. Using a newly developed smartphone app, I collected a panel data set with precise GPS coordinates for over 100,000 com-muter trips in Bangalore, India. To identify the key preference parameters in my model – the value of time spent driving and schedule flexibility – I designed and implemented a randomized experiment with two realistic congestion charge policies. The policies penalize peak-hour depar-ture times and driving through a small charged area, respectively. Structural estimates based on the experiment show that commuters exhibit moderate schedule flexibility and high value of time. In a separate analysis of the road technology, I find a moderate and linear effect of traffic volume on travel time. I combine the preference parameters and road technology using policy simulations of the equilibrium optimal congestion charge, which reveal notable travel time bene-fits, yet negligible welfare gains. Intuitively, the social value of the travel time saved by removing commuters from the peak-hour is not significantly larger than the costs to those commuters of traveling at different, inconvenient times. * I am deeply grateful to my advisers Ben Olken, Esther Duflo, Frank Schilbach, and Edward Glaeser for their advice and generous support throughout this project.

abstract = {We show how urban commuting flows extracted from cell phone transaction data can be used to measure the spatial distribution of income and economic activity within cities. We use data from Dhaka and Colombo to construct commuting flow matrices for several million users in each metropolis, with fine spatial coverage and daily frequency. We relate commuting to productivity using a model of workplace choice that predicts a gravity equation. We recover workplace labor productivity values that rationalize observed commuting patterns; this procedure essentially assigns higher productivity to locations with higher in-commuting, ceteris paribus. Empirically, we show that commuting flows from cell phone data correlate strongly with flows from a transportation survey in Dhaka. We then show that model-predicted income is a robust predictor of self-reported survey income. We apply our method to measure spatial and temporal variation in economic activity. First, we compare the urban economic structures of Dhaka and Colombo. Secondly, we calculate the economic costs of hartals (a form of strike) and find that people travel less on hartal days, an effect concentrated on routes with high predicted income. members of the LIRNEasia BD4D team (Dedunu Dhananjaya, Kaushalya Madhawa, and Nisansa de Silva), and seminar participants at MIT, LIRNEasia, NEUDC 2016, and the Harvard Urban Development mini-conference for constructive comments and feedback.

I study an unexpected, large scale driving restriction policy experiment in Delhi. In the short run, around half of the affected drivers are able to lawfully bypass it by switching to existing unrestricted private travel modes. However, consistent with high marginal rates of congestion, the policy also led to a precisely estimated decrease in average driving travel time excess delay. I provide suggestive evidence that both effects are broadly similar during a second, anticipated round of the policy. Methodologically, this paper makes two contributions: traffic congestion is quantified using rich data from Google Maps, and short-term driving substitution patterns are identified using panel daily driver data and the essentially random assignment of odd and even license plates. },

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the urban wage premium and addresses two central issues about which the field has not yet reached a consensus: first, the extent to which sorting of high ability individuals into urban areas explains the urban wage premium and second, whether workers receive this wage premium immediately, or through faster wage growth over time. Using a large panel of worker-level data from Britain, we first demonstrate the existence of an urban premium for wage levels, which increases in city size. We next provide evidence of a city size premium on wage growth, but show that this effect is driven purely by the increase in wage that occurs in the first year that a worker moves to a larger location. Controlling for sorting on the basis of unobservables we find no evidence of an urban wage growth premium. Experience in cities does have some impact on wage growth, however. Specifically, we show that workers who have at some point worked in a city experience faster wage growth than those who have never worked in a city. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

While migrants to small cities do not exhibit selection of any type, migrants to big cities are positively selected in terms of education, occupational skills, and individual productivity as proxied by their pre-migration position in the local earnings distribution. However, not everyone benefits equally from big cities and this leads to a second round of sorting. Returnees are not only ex-ante less productive than permanent migrants, but are also those who, following the first move, have least boosted up their earnings in big cities. Low realized earnings and unemployment affect return decisions of workers who moved to big cities at younger ages in particular, suggesting that older migrants may face less uncertainty upon moving to big cities.},

We compare American metropolitan areas with analogous geographic units in Brazil, China and India. Both Gibrat's Law and Zipf's Law seem to hold as well in Brazil as in the U.S., but China and India look quite different. In Brazil and China, the implications of the spatial equilibrium hypothesis, the central organizing idea of urban economics, are not rejected. The India data, however, repeatedly rejects tests inspired by the spatial equilibrium assumption. One hypothesis is that spatial equilibrium only emerges with economic development, as markets replace social relationships and as human capital spreads more widely. In all four countries there is strong evidence of agglomeration economies and human capital externalities. The correlation between density and earnings is stronger in both China and India than in the U.S., strongest in China. In India the gap between urban and rural wages is huge, but the correlation between city size and earnings is more modest. The cross-sectional relationship between area-level skills and both earnings and area-level growth are also stronger in the developing world than in the U.S. The forces that drive urban success seem similar in the rich and poor world, even if limited migration and difficult housing markets make it harder for a spatial equilibrium to develop.},

Agglomeration economies and human capital spillovers suggest that such policies could enhance welfare. However, the mere existence of agglomeration externalities does not indicate which places should be subsidized. Without a better understanding of nonlinearities in these externalities, any government spatial policy is as likely to reduce as to increase welfare. Transportation spending has historically done much to make or break particular places, but current transportation spending subsidizes low-income, low-density places where agglomeration effects are likely to be weakest. Most large-scale place-oriented policies have had little discernable impact. Some targeted policies such as Empowerment Zones seem to have an effect but are expensive relative to their achievements. The greatest promise for a national place-based policy lies in impeding the tendency of highly productive areas to restrict their own growth through restrictions on land use.},

We find evidence of a large positive correlation of the city share of migrants with natives' wages. Using different sets of control variables and instruments suggests that the effect is causal. The large total migrant impact (+10{\%} when one moves from the first to the third quartile of the migrant variable distribution) arises from gains due to complementarity with natives in the production function (+6.4{\%}), and from gains due to agglomeration economies (+3.3{\%}). Finally, we find some evidence of a stronger effect for skilled natives than for unskilled, as expected from theory. Overall, our findings support large nominal wage gains that can be expected from further migration and urbanisation in China.},

This paper examines this implication using data on a sample of young male workers drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort. The results suggest that earnings growth does tend to be faster in large, economically diverse local labor markets-defined as counties and metropolitan areas-than in smaller, more specialized markets. Yet, when examined in greater detail, I also find that this association tends to be the product of faster wage growth due to job changes rather than faster wage growth experienced while on a particular job. This result is consistent with the idea that cities enhance worker productivity through a job search and matching process and, thus, that an important aspect of 'learning' in cities may involve individuals learning about what they do well. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We study the long-run effects of one of the most ambitious regional development programs in U.S. history: the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Using as controls authorities that were proposed but never approved by Congress, we find that the TVA led to large gains in agricultural employment that were eventually reversed when the program's subsidies ended. Gains in manufacturing employment, by contrast, continued to intensify well after federal transfers had lapsed—a pattern consistent with the presence of agglomeration economies in manufacturing. Because manufacturing paid higher wages than agriculture, this shift raised aggregate income in the TVA region for an extended period of time. Economists have long cautioned that the local gains created by place-based policies may be offset by losses elsewhere. We develop a structured approach to assessing the TVA's aggregate consequences that is applicable to other place-based policies. In our model, the TVA affects the national economy both directly through infrastructure improvements and indirectly through agglomeration economies. The model's estimates suggest that the TVA's direct investments yielded a significant increase in national manufacturing productivity, with benefits exceeding the program's costs. However, the program's indirect effects appear to have been limited: agglomeration gains in the TVA region were offset by losses in the rest of the country. Spillovers in manufacturing appear to be the rare example of a localized market failure that cancels out in the aggregate.},

abstract = {With an estimated one hundred fifteen million children not attending primary school in the developing world, increasing access to education is critical. This paper highlights a supply-side factor - the availability of low-cost teachers - and the resulting ability of the market to offer affordable education. We first show that private schools are three times more likely to emerge in villages with government girls' secondary schools (GSSs). Identification is obtained by using official school construction guidelines as an instrument for the presence of GSSs. In contrast, private school presence shows little or no relationship with girls' primary or boys' primary and secondary government schools. In support of a supply-channel, we then show that, villages which received a GSS have over twice as many educated women, and private school teachers' wages are 27{\%} lower in these villages. In an environment with low female education and mobility, GSSs substantially increase the local supply of skilled women lowering wages locally and allowing the market to offer affordable education. These findings highlight the prominent role of women as teachers in facilitating educational access and resonate with similar historical evidence from developed economies. The students of today are the teachers of tomorrow. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

Contributing factors include externalities from infectious disease prevention, public goods problems, liquidity constraints, and behavioral factors, such as present bias and limited attention. Across a variety of contexts, consumer use of cost-effective products for prevention and non-acute care is highly sensitive to price and convenience. Health education has a mixed record, often working in combination with incentives and functioning through increasing salience rather than delivering information. The quality of health services in many developing countries is very poor, with weak incentives for public sector health workers. Reforms that strengthen incentives show promise but institutional details matter.

@book{Skoufias2005,
abstract = {In early 1998, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) was asked to assist the PROGRESA administration to "determine if PROGRESA is functioning in practice as it is intended to by design." This document synthesizes the findings contained in a series of reports prepared by IFPRI for PROGRESA between November 1998 and November 2000. A more detailed description of the research, rationale, and methods appears in the original IFPRI reports, which are provided in English and in Spanish on the CD enclosed with this publication. PROGRESA is one of the major programs of the Mexican government aimed at developing the human capital of poor households. Targeting its benefits directly to the population in extreme poverty in rural areas, PROGRESA aims to alleviate current and future poverty levels through cash transfers to mothers in households. The cash transfers provided are conditioned on regular school attendance and visits to health care centers. At the end of 1999, PROGRESA covered approximately 2.6 million families, representing one ninth of all families in Mexico; the beneficiaries comprised about 40 percent of all rural families. At that time, the program operated in almost 50,000 localities in more than 2,000 municipalities and 31 states. PROGRESA's budget of approximately US{\$}777 million in 1999 was equivalent to 0.2 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP). For Mexico, the design of PROGRESA represents a significant change in the provision of social programs. First, in contrast to previous poverty alleviation programs in Mexico, PROGRESA applies targeting at the household level to ensure that the resources of the program are directed and delivered to households in extreme poverty, that is, the households that can most benefit from the program. General food subsidies, such as the tortilla price subsidy [Subsidio a la Tortilla (TORTIBONO)], are widely acknowledged to have had a high cost in the government budget and a negligible effect on poverty because of the leakage of benefits to non-poor households. In addition, more decentralized, community-based, demand-driven programs such as the earlier anti-poverty program PRONASOL, in place during 1988 and 1994, were thought to be susceptible to local political influences and not very effective at reaching those in extreme poverty.1 Under PROGRESA, communities are first selected using a marginality index based on census data. Then, within the selected communities, households are chosen using socioeconomic data collected for all households in the community. Second, unlike earlier social programs in Mexico, PROGRESA contains a multisectoral focus. By design, the program intervenes simultaneously in health, education, and nutrition. The integrated nature of the program reflects a belief that addressing all dimensions of human capital simultaneously has greater social returns than their implementation in isolation. Improved health and nutritional status not only are desirable in themselves, but also have an indirect impact through enhancing the effectiveness of education programs, since, for example, school attendance and performance are often adversely affected by poor health and nutrition. Poor health is therefore both a cause as well as a consequence of poverty. Also by design, PROGRESA differs in the mechanism of delivering its resources. Recognizing the potential of mothers to use resources effectively and efficiently in a manner that reflects the immediate needs of the family, PROGRESA gives benefits exclusively to mothers. Specifically, the education component of PROGRESA is designed to increase school enrollment among youth in Mexico's poor rural communities by making education grants available to pupils' mothers, who then are required to have their children attend school regularly. In localities where PROGRESA currently operates, households that have been characterized as poor, and have children enrolled in grades 3-9, are eligible to receive these educational grants every two months. The levels of these grants were determined taking into account, among other factors, what a child would earn in the labor force or contribute to family production. The educational grants are slightly higher at the secondary level for girls, given their propensity to drop out at earlier ages. Every two months, confirmation of whether children of beneficiary families attend school more than 85 percent of the time is submitted to PROGRESA by schoolteachers and directors, and this triggers the receipt of bimonthly cash transfers for school attendance. In the area of health and nutrition, PROGRESA brings basic attention to health issues and promotes health care through free preventive interventions, such as distribution of nutritional supplements, and education on hygiene and nutrition as well as monetary transfers for the purchase of food. Receipt of monetary transfers and nutritional supplements is tied to mandatory health care visits to public clinics. This aspect of the program emphasizes targeting benefits to children under five, and pregnant and lactating women, and is administered by the Ministry of Health and by IMSS-Solidaridad, a branch of the Mexican Social Security Institute, which provides benefits to uninsured individuals in rural areas. Nutritional supplements are given to children between the ages of four months and two years, and to pregnant and breastfeeding women. If signs of malnutrition are detected in children between two and five years of age, nutritional supplements will also be administered. The nutritional status of beneficiaries is monitored by mandatory visits to the clinic and is more frequently monitored for children five years of age and under and pregnant and lactating women. At each visit, young children and lactating women are measured for wasting (weight-for-height), stunting (height-for-age), and weight-for-age. An appointment monitoring system is set up and a nurse or doctor verifies adherence. Every two months the health care professionals submit certification of beneficiary visits to PROGRESA, which triggers the receipt of the cash transfer for food support. The average monthly payment (received every two months) by a beneficiary family amounts to 20 percent of the value of monthly consumption expenditures prior to the initiation of the program. One additional requirement of the PROGRESA program is that households benefiting from PROGRESA were to stop receiving benefits from other programs in effect, such as Ni{\~{n}}os de Solidaridad, Abasto Social de Leche, de Tortilla, and the National Institute of Indigenous People (INI). This requirement of the PROGRESA program represents the short-run objective of the new poverty alleviation strategy of the Mexican government to minimize duplication of benefits to poor families. A longer run objective is to absorb the variety of poverty alleviation programs within one program such as PROGRESA that represents an integrated approach to poverty alleviation. Poverty alleviation programs such as PROGRESA are an important component of the set of instruments that government has at its disposal for redistributing income and assets among households. Program evaluation can improve the design and implementation of programs so that they can have a greater effect on household welfare. In addition, program evaluation, when applied consistently across a wide spectrum of programs, allows governments to have a stronger effect on social welfare with the same budget by reallocating resources from less to more effective programs. In addition to these economic considerations, there are also social and political reasons for justifying program evaluations. Primary among these is that program evaluation can serve as a means of increasing the accountability of governments toward their citizens by providing a template for comparing sensibly whether public funds are used effectively toward poverty alleviation. In the case of PROGRESA the national elections that were forthcoming in the year 2000 and the increasing public support toward the opposition parties contributed to an unprecedented willingness by the Zedillo administration to support a rigorous and politically neutral evaluation of the program. It is hard to dismiss the interpretation that the design of the program, with its careful targeting of the benefits to poor rural households, along with the decision to evaluate PROGRESA, also served political purposes. For example, the targeting of the program to households in extreme poverty and the provision of the cash transfers directly to the beneficiary households signaled a break from the wasteful practices of the past. At the same time, the decision to evaluate the program established a precedent that any future administration could hardly afford not to imitate. Until the implementation of PROGRESA in Mexico, as in most developing countries, national poverty alleviation programs were not customarily subjected to rigorous evaluations. In the rare instances in which programs were evaluated, the decision to do so was usually taken years after the implementation of the program. In such situations, it is typically too late to evaluate the program because the program has already achieved wide coverage and it is practically impossible to construct a reliable comparison group that is essential for the credible evaluation of the program's impact. PROGRESA distinguishes itself further by the fact that the elements essential for a rigorous evaluation of the program's impact were taken into consideration since the very early stages of the implementation of the program. The strategy adopted for the evaluation of PROGRESA consisted of the following two critical elements. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 International Food Policy Research Institute.

@article{Hanushek1995,
abstract = {Policymakers in developing countries have long been troubled by the unde-sirable, but apparently unavoidable, choice between providing broad access to education and developing high-quality schools. Recent evidence, how-ever, suggests that this is a bad way to think about human capital develop-ment. Grade repetition and high dropout rates lead to a significant waste of resources in many school systems. Students in quality schools, however, re-spond in ways that reduce such inefficiencies, perhaps even sufficiently to recoup immediately investments in quality. Promoting high-quality schools, however, is more difficult than many have thought, in part because research demonstrates that the traditional approach to providing quality-simply providing more inputs-is frequently ineffec-tive. Existing inefficiencies are likely to be alleviated only by the introduc-tion of substantially stronger performance incentives in schools and by more extensive experimentation and evaluation of educational programs and school organizations. Incentives, decentralized decisionmaking, and evaluation are alien terms to education, in both industrial and developing countries, but they hold the key to improvement that has eluded policymakers pursuing traditional practices. R ecent research into schooling has begun to point consistently toward education policies that differ sharply from much of what we have seen in the past. In particular, it points more toward performance incentives and less toward regulatory and input-based policies, and it underscores the im-portance of developing high-quality schools, even if this goal appears to impinge on access to schools. Three fundamental findings flow from the new research. First, education around the globe is a very inefficient exercise; strong evidence indicates that too much is being paid for the performance obtained from schools. Second, educa-tion has proved to be a very complicated subject, and available research has},

While the targets of the drone strikes are ostensibly Islamist militants, who mobilize religion to attract supporters to their cause, this paper argues that the principal grounds of opposition to the drone strikes in Pakistan are not religious in nature. Instead, most Pakistanis oppose the strikes because their only knowledge of them comes from highly negative coverage in the elite media.

abstract = {Education-oriented social programs, known as “Bolsa Escola”, aim to provide poor families with children with a monetary stipend, so as to enable and stimulate them to send their children to school. In Brazil, several programs of this type existed since the mid-1990s, and came together under a federal program in 2001. In 2004, the Brazilian government brought Bolsa Escola together with other minimum income programs to create a comprehensive family stipend program (Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia). This paper examines the education and equity impacts of education-oriented social programs with data provided by the Brazilian National Household Survey of 2003. The analysis shows that these programs are not well focused from an education point of view. They are better focused from a minimum income policy point of view, but with limitations. The paper concludes that these policies are not properly grounded in research, and are based on wrong assumptions.},

When producers are densely clustered in a market, it is easier for consumers to switch between suppliers (making the market in a certain sense more competitive). Relatively inefficient producers find it more difficult to operate profitably as a result. Increases in substitutability truncate the productivity distribution from below, resulting in higher minimum and average productivity levels as well as less productivity dispersion.

We use an original data set of 146 U.S. cities to obtain variations in the extent to which they are populated by managerial firms or knowledge clusters. By utilizing city-level measures of managerial salaries, we test how the intensity of managerial corporation versus knowledge cluster characteristics affects the mean and dispersion of the “rewards” of cities. Our evidence suggests that higher managerial corporate characteristics lower the vari- ability of rewards, while they have no effect on the mean of rewards. Higher-knowledge cluster characteristics produce both higher dispersion and higher expected rewards. We explain these results by looking at the different learning mechanisms of the two organizational types. In so doing, we highlight the role of intra- and interfirm knowledge processes as important sources of differences in the rewards of the two models. From an empirical point of view, results are confirmed using both patent-based and skill mobility–based measures of knowledge spillovers.},

We find that as the postal system expanded, the spatial scope of competition among magazines increased: magazines in distant locations exerted more negative effects on local founding rates, whereas magazines in the focal location exerted less positive effects on local founding rates These findings reveal how spatial barriers to competition shape the geography of entrepreneurial activity.},

This paper examines whether and when state technical capabilities attract foreign investment in manufacturing from 1987-1993. We find that on average state R{\&}D intensity does not attract foreign direct investment. Most investing firms are in lower-tech industries and locate in low R{\&}D intensity states, suggesting little interest in state technical capabilities. In con- trast, we find that firms in research-intensive industries are more likely to locate in states with high R{\&}D intensity. Foreign firms in the pharmaceutical industry value state R{\&}D intensity the most, at a level twice that of firms in the semiconductor industry, and four times that of electronics firms. Interestingly, not only firms from technically lagging nations, but also some firms from technically leading nations are attracted to R{\&}D intensive states. This suggests that beyond catching up, firms use knowledge-seeking investments also to source technical diversity},

In so doing, we elucidate why different types of industrial districts have different structures, and different competitive implications. We introduce four archetypes of industrial districts (based on extreme values of our two dimensions), and for each we discuss the benefits and costs of locating in the district, the sources of competitive advantage for members of the district vis-a-vis non-members, and the sources of competitive advantage a district firm may gain over other members of the same district.},

We then use the framework to estimate the topography of trade costs, productivities and amenities in the United States. We find that geographic location accounts for at least twenty percent of the spatial variation in U.S. income.

abstract = {Motivated by differences in innovation intensity across advanced economies, this paper presents an empirical examination of the determinants of country-level production of international patents.We introduce a novel framework based on the concept of national innovative capacity. National innovative capacity is the ability of a country to produce and commercialize a flowof innovative technology over the long term.National innovative capacity depends on the strength of a nation's common innova- tion infrastructure (cross-cutting factors which contribute broadly to innovativeness throughout the economy), the environment for innovation in a nation's industrial clusters, and the strength of linkages between these two.We use this framework to guide an empirical exploration into the determinants of country-level differences in innovation intensity, examining the relationship between international patenting (patenting by foreign countries in United States) and variables associated with the national innovative capacity framework. While there are important measurement issues arising from the use of patent data, the results suggest that the production function for international patents is well-characterized by a small but nuanced set of observable factors. We find that while a great deal of variation across countries is due to differences in the level of inputs devoted to innovation (R{\&}D manpower and spending), an extremely important role is played by factors associated with differences in R{\&}Dproductivity (policy choices such as the extent of IP protection and openness to international trade, the share of research performed by the academic sector and funded by the private sector, the degree of technological specialization, and each individual country's knowledge “stock”). Further, national innovative capacity influences downstream commercialization, such as achieving a high market share of high-technology export markets. Finally, there has been convergence among OECD countries in terms of the estimated level of innovative capacity over the past quarter century},

This article exploits China's National Trunk Highway System as a large-scale natural experiment to contribute to our understanding of this question. The network was designed to connect provincial capitals and cities with an urban population above 500,000. As a side effect, a large number of small peripheral counties were connected to large metropolitan agglomerations. To address non-random route placements on thewaybetween targeted city nodes, I propose an instrumental variable strategy based on the construction of least cost path spanning tree networks. The estimation results suggest that network connections have led to a reduction in GDP growth among non-targeted peripheral counties. This effect appears to be driven by a significant reduction in industrial output growth. Additional results present evidence in support of a trade-based channel in the light of falling trade costs between peripheral and metropolitan regions.},

We deal with the central problem of endogenous scheme placement by using changes due to new road links and exploiting the spatial detail in our data to focus on accessibility changes close to new schemes. We find substantial effects on employment and numbers of plants for small-scale geographical areas (electoral wards), but no employment response at plant level. This suggests that road construction affects firm entry and exit, but not the employment of existing firms. We also find effects on labour productivity and wages at the firm level, although these results are less robust.},

However, prior work has typically examined this phenomenon considering only one geographic unit—country, state, or metropolitan area—at a time and has rarely accounted for spatial distance. We disentangle these multiple effects by using a regression framework employing choice-based sampling to estimate the likelihood of citation between random patents. We find both country and state borders to have independent effects on knowledge diffusion beyond what just geographic proximity in the formof metropolitan collocation or shorter within-region distances can explain. An identification methodology comparing inventor-added and examiner-added citation patterns points to an even stronger role of political borders. The puzzling state border effect remains robust on average across analyses, though it is found to have waned with time. The country effect has, in contrast, not only remained robust but even strengthened over time.},

We examine the economics of firm location choice with a duopoly model that allows for asymmetric contributions by firms to production externalities. In the model, the magnitude of a firm's contributions to industry agglomeration externalities is determined by its R{\&}D levels and by how closely it locates to the other firm. Through numerical simulations, the effects of firm heterogeneity on industry geographical organization are evaluated. Specifically, the relationships between industry agglomeration strength, R{\&}D investment, location choice timing and Nash equilibria industry structures are explored. The findings from this exercise indicate that geographic collocation tends to occur in industries with symmetry in firm R{\&}D spending and where high R{\&}D firms are the initial entrants. Moreover, we find that under some industry conditions, strengthened agglomeration economies encourage firms to locate more distant from each other rather than collocate. Finally, our simulations also show that firms' profits tend to increase yet total welfare decreases as agglomeration economies strengthen. ?? 2003.},

I prove that under an equilibrium refinement, all economically relevant firm outcomes are uniquely determined across all strict subgame perfect Nash equilibria. There are two central results. First, a firm's price, market share, and profit are independent of its neighbors' marginal costs, conditional on the average marginal cost in the market. Second, more productive firms are more isolated, all else equal. In particular, the distance between two firms is strictly decreasing in their average marginal cost.},

I then provide empirical evidence consistent with the hypothesized mechanisms by exploiting an unexpected random relocation of researchers due to asbestos removal at UPMC Paris (1997-2011). Results are consistent with the theory: random versus chosen co-location leads to higher levels of experimentation (variance of citations to papers), and has a positive impact on breakthrough ideas for collaborations across academic fields.},

abstract = {Assessing the productivity gains from multinational production has been a vital topic of economic research. Positive aggregate productivity gains are often attributed to within-firm productivity improvement; however, an alternative, less emphasized explanation is between-firm selection and market reallocation, whereby competition from multinationals leads to factor reallocation and the survival of only the most productive domestic firms. We investigate the roles of the two different mechanisms in determining the aggregate productivity gains by exploring their distinct predictions on the distributions of domestic firms: within-firm productivity improvement shifts the productivity and the revenue distributions rightward while between-firm selection and market reallocation raise the left truncation of the distributions and shift revenue leftward. Using a rich cross-country firm-level panel dataset, we find significant evidence of both mechanisms, but between-firm selection and market reallocation accounts for the majority of aggregate productivity gains, suggesting that ignoring this channel could lead to substantial bias in understanding the nature of gains from multinational production.},

Nonetheless, certain goods are sometimes produced by multiple firms, all of which are located in the same region. These goods are then exported from the regions in which their production is agglomerated. Regional agglomeration of production and trade stem from two forces. First, competition between firms for the services of trained workers makes it easier for workers to recoup the cost of acquiring industry-specific human capital. Second, the technology of production is more efficient when plants are larger than a minimum efficient scale and local demand is insufficient to support several firms of that scale. We also study the policy implications of our model. {\textcopyright}2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

I explore these questions using the worldwide location decisions of firms in the cellular handset industry.

The free-entry equilibrium for rational noncollusive firms is characterized for atomistic firms and for firms of fixed size, and some analytic results are obtained for the more realistic case in which firms have an arbitrary cost function. Numerical results for the associations implied between concentration, industry profitability, fixed entry costs, and the dispersion of firm profitabilities are obtained for selected cases.

According to the agglomeration perspective, spillover from adjacent competitors pull firms close to similar competitors.

We implement the algorithm using 2009 data for U.S. industries (six-digit NAICS), and propose a new set of benchmark cluster definitions that incorporates measures of inter-industry linkages based on co-location patterns, input–output links, and similarities in labor occupations. We also illustrate the algorithm's ability to compare alternative sets of cluster definitions by evaluating our new set against existing sets in the literature. We find that our proposed set outperforms other methods in capturing a wide range of inter-industry linkages, including the grouping of industries within the same three-digit NAICS.},

In this paper we propose that a firm's embeddedness in a network of ties is an important source of variation in the acquisition of competitive capabilities.

Hypotheses based on these ideas were tested on a stratified random sample of 227 job shop manufacturers located in the Midwest United States. Data were gathered using a mailed questionnaire. Results from structural equation modeling broadly support the embeddedness hypotheses and suggest a number of insights about the link between firms' networks and the acquisition of competitive capabilities.

Significant associations between firm growth and other-sector employment are less common, but where these arise they are generally negative.

The rate of return patterns established in earlier reviews are upheld: namely, that primary education continues to be the number one investment priority in developing countries; the returns decline by the level of schooling and the country's per capita income; investment in women's education is in general more profitable than that for men; returns in the private competitive sector of the economy are higher than among those working in the public sector; and that the public financing of higher education is regressive. The above findings are discussed in the context of controversies in the field, concluding that investment in education continues to be a very attractive investment opportunity in the world today-both from the private and the social point of view. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

We combine the cross-regional analysis of geographic, institutional, cultural, and human capital determinants of regional development with an examination of productivity in several thou- sand establishments located in these regions. To organize the discussion, we present a new model of regional development that introduces into a standard migration framework elements of both the Lucas (1978) model of the allocation of talent between entrepreneurship and work, and the Lucas (1988) model of human capital externalities. The evidence points to the paramount importance of human capital in accounting for regional differences in development, but also suggests from model estimation and calibration that entrepreneurial inputs and possibly human capital externalities help understand the data.},

We confirm that on average, workers in denser areas are more skilled. There is also strong over-representation of workers with particularly high and low skills in denser areas. These features are consistent with patterns of migration including negative selection of migrants to less dense areas and positive selection towards denser areas. Nonetheless migration, even in the long-run, accounts for little of the skill differences between denser and less dense areas. Finally, we find marked differences across age groups and some suggestions that much of the skill differences across areas can be explained by differences between occupational groups rather than within. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

The 10{\%} increase of the nominal wage is attributed to the productivity increase in production activities while the 7-12{\%} decrease of the real wage is a compensation for the net agglomeration economies, which are the benefits from product variety minus the costs of congestion. In other words, city bigness not only enhances the productivity of firms but also brings net agglomeration economies to households. In this way, we separate the net agglomeration economies on the production side from those on the consumption side. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

Two main explanations have been offered: firm selection (larger cities toughen competition, allowing only the most productive to survive) and agglomeration economies (larger cities promote interac tions that increase productivity), possibly reinforced by localized natural advantage. To distinguish between them, we nest a generalized version of a tractable firm selection model and a standard model of agglomeration. Stronger selection in larger cities left truncates the productivity distribution, whereas stronger agglomeration right-shifts and dilates the distribution. Using this prediction, French establishment-level data, and a new quantile approach, we show that firm selection cannot explain spatial productivity differences. This result holds across sectors, city size thresholds, establishment samples, and area definitions.},

To empirically disentangle alternative determinants of location choices, we use Berlin's division and reunification as a source of exogenous variation in the surrounding concentration of economic activity. Using disaggregated data on land prices, workplace employment and residence employment for thousands of city blocks for 1936, 1986 and 2006, we find that the model can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure.},

We discuss the measurement of coagglomeration and use data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database from 1972 to 1997 to compute pairwise coagglomeration measurements for U.S. manufacturing industries. Industry attributes are used to construct measures of the relevance of each of Marshall's three theories of industry agglomeration to each industry pair: (1) agglomeration saves transport costs by proximity to input suppliers or final consumers, (2) agglomeration allows for labor market pooling, and (3) agglomeration facilitates intellectual spillovers. We assess the importance of the theories via regressions of coagglomeration indices on these measures. Data on characteristics of corresponding industries in the United Kingdom are used as instruments. We find evidence to support each mechanism. Our results suggest that input-output dependencies are the most important factor, followed by labor pooling.},

While local labor demand changes fundamentally caused the increased skill sorting, it was further fueled by endogenous increases in amenities within higher skill cities. Changes in cities' wages, rents, and endogenous amenities increased inequality between high school and college graduates by more than suggested by the increase in the college wage gap alone.

We compare American metropolitan areas with analogous geographic units in Brazil, China and India. Both Gibrat's Law and Zipf's Law seem to hold as well in Brazil as in the U.S., but China and India look quite different. In Brazil and China, the implications of the spatial equilibrium hypothesis, the central organizing idea of urban economics, are not rejected. The India data, however, repeatedly rejects tests inspired by the spatial equilibrium assumption. One hypothesis is that spatial equilibrium only emerges with economic development, as markets replace social relationships and as human capital spreads more widely. In all four countries there is strong evidence of agglomeration economies and human capital externalities. The correlation between density and earnings is stronger in both China and India than in the U.S., strongest in China. In India the gap between urban and rural wages is huge, but the correlation between city size and earnings is more modest. The cross-sectional relationship between area-level skills and both earnings and area-level growth are also stronger in the developing world than in the U.S. The forces that drive urban success seem similar in the rich and poor world, even if limited migration and difficult housing markets make it harder for a spatial equilibrium to develop.},

abstract = {Individual earnings are higher in bigger cities.We consider three reasons: spatial sorting of initially more productive workers, static advantages from workers' current location, and learning by working in bigger cities. Using rich administrative data for Spain, we find that workers in bigger cities do not have higher initial unobserved ability as reflected in fixed effects. Instead, they obtain an immediate static premium and accumulate more valuable experience. The additional value of experience in bigger cities persists after leaving and is stronger for those with higher initial ability. This explains both the higher mean and greater dispersion of earnings in bigger cities.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the urban wage premium and addresses two central issues about which the field has not yet reached a consensus: first, the extent to which sorting of high ability individuals into urban areas explains the urban wage premium and second, whether workers receive this wage premium immediately, or through faster wage growth over time. Using a large panel of worker-level data from Britain, we first demonstrate the existence of an urban premium for wage levels, which increases in city size. We next provide evidence of a city size premium on wage growth, but show that this effect is driven purely by the increase in wage that occurs in the first year that a worker moves to a larger location. Controlling for sorting on the basis of unobservables we find no evidence of an urban wage growth premium. Experience in cities does have some impact on wage growth, however. Specifically, we show that workers who have at some point worked in a city experience faster wage growth than those who have never worked in a city. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

The model remains tractable and amenable to empirical analysis because of stochastic shocks to worker productivity, which yield a gravity equation for commuting flows. To empirically disentangle alternative determinants of location choices, we use Berlin's division and reunification as a source of exogenous variation in the surrounding concentration of economic activity. Using disaggregated data on land prices, workplace employment and residence employment for thousands of city blocks for 1936, 1986 and 2006, we find that the model can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure.},

abstract = {Firms are more productive, on average, in larger cities. Two main explanations have been offered: firm selection (larger cities toughen competition, allowing only the most productive to survive) and agglomeration economies (larger cities promote interac tions that increase productivity), possibly reinforced by localized natural advantage. To distinguish between them, we nest a generalized version of a tractable firm selection model and a standard model of agglomeration. Stronger selection in larger cities left truncates the productivity distribution, whereas stronger agglomeration right-shifts and dilates the distribution. Using this prediction, French establishment-level data, and a new quantile approach, we show that firm selection cannot explain spatial productivity differences. This result holds across sectors, city size thresholds, establishment samples, and area definitions.},

We discuss the measurement of coagglomeration and use data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database from 1972 to 1997 to compute pairwise coagglomeration measurements for U.S. manufacturing industries. Industry attributes are used to construct measures of the relevance of each of Marshall's three theories of industry agglomeration to each industry pair: (1) agglomeration saves transport costs by proximity to input suppliers or final consumers, (2) agglomeration allows for labor market pooling, and (3) agglomeration facilitates intellectual spillovers. We assess the importance of the theories via regressions of coagglomeration indices on these measures. Data on characteristics of corresponding industries in the United Kingdom are used as instruments. We find evidence to support each mechanism. Our results suggest that input-output dependencies are the most important factor, followed by labor pooling.},

While migrants to small cities do not exhibit selection of any type, migrants to big cities are positively selected in terms of education, occupational skills, and individual productivity as proxied by their pre-migration position in the local earnings distribution. However, not everyone benefits equally from big cities and this leads to a second round of sorting. Returnees are not only ex-ante less productive than permanent migrants, but are also those who, following the first move, have least boosted up their earnings in big cities. Low realized earnings and unemployment affect return decisions of workers who moved to big cities at younger ages in particular, suggesting that older migrants may face less uncertainty upon moving to big cities.},

The 10{\%} increase of the nominal wage is attributed to the productivity increase in production activities while the 7-12{\%} decrease of the real wage is a compensation for the net agglomeration economies, which are the benefits from product variety minus the costs of congestion. In other words, city bigness not only enhances the productivity of firms but also brings net agglomeration economies to households. In this way, we separate the net agglomeration economies on the production side from those on the consumption side. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

Simultaneously, the rate of non-employment for working age men has nearly tripled over the last 50 years, generating a terrible social problem that is disproportionately centered in the eastern parts of the American heartland. Should more permanent economic divisions across space lead American economists to rethink their traditional skepticism about place-based policies? We document that increases in labor demand appear to have greater impacts on employment in areas where not working has been historically high, suggesting that subsidizing employment in such places could particularly reduce the not working rate. Pro-employment policies, such as a ramped up Earned Income Tax Credit, that are targeted towards regions with more elastic employment responses, however financed, could plausibly reduce suffering and materially improve economic performance},

A growing class of place-based policies attempts to address these differences through public investments and subsidies that target disadvantaged neighborhoods, cities, or regions. Place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the United States and throughout the world but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place-based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective? To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place-based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place-based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects.

I derive two main results related to (i) the effect of parental migration on children's human capital, and (ii) the effects of government policies that increase services for children. First, I show that if government spending is a substitute for parental spending and parent time with the child is weakly complementary to spending on the child, then children's human capital decreases as they become left-behind by migrant parents. This sheds light on a puzzle in the empirical literature about the ambiguous effects of parental migration on the human capital of left-behind children. Second, in some cases, government policies that increase services for rural children have the unintended consequence of separating children from parents due to endogenous migration effects, thereby reducing child human capital. More broadly, the analysis demonstrates how focusing on marginal treatment effects can facilitate signing comparative statics that are otherwise difficult to sign.},

Throughout the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, many new colleges were established in the U.S. I use data on the site selection decisions for a subset of these colleges to identify " losing finalist " locations that were strongly considered to become the site of a new college but were ultimately not chosen for reasons that are as good as random assignment. The losing finalists are similar to the winning college counties along observable dimensions. Using the losing finalists as counterfactuals, I find that the establishment of a new college caused 32{\%} more patents per year in college counties relative to the losing finalists. To determine the channels by which colleges increase patenting, I use a novel dataset of college yearbooks and individual-level census data to learn who the additional patents in college counties come from. A college's alumni account for about 10{\%} of the additional patents, while faculty account for less than 1{\%}. Knowledge spillovers to individuals unaffiliated with the college also account for less than 1{\%} of the additional patents. Migration is the most important channel by which colleges affect local invention, as controlling for county population accounts for 20-40{\%} of the increase in patenting in college counties relative to the losing finalists. The presence of geographic spillovers suggests that colleges do cause an overall net increase in patenting, although I find no evidence that colleges are better at promoting invention than other policies that lead to similar increases in population.},

@article{Castells-Quintana2017,
abstract = {The link between urban concentration (primacy) and economic growth at country level is not straightforward, as there are benefits as well as costs associated with urban primacy. Recent empirical evidence suggests a differential negative effect of concentration in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to the rest of the world. This paper revisits the literature on urban concentration and economic growth to shed some light on these recent results. The main contribution of the paper is to show how differentiated effects of urban primacy on economic growth can be accounted for by considering a role for the quality of the urban environment (in terms of urban infrastructure). The role of urban infrastructure is found to be robust to a long list of controls, different specifications, different estimation techniques, and potential bias from simultaneity and measurement error.},

The paper estimates the city-by-city variation in the prices of capital across cities in China from 1998 to 2007. It relates how the prices facing the highest order political units and overall cross-city price dispersion change with changes in national policy and leadership. The effect of capital market favoritism on city growth after the national relaxation of migration restrictions in the early 2000's is investigated. The elasticity of the city growth rate with respect to the price of capital is estimated to be −0.07 in the OLS approach and −0.12 in the IV approach.},

abstract = {Gibrat's law, the orthogonality of growth with initial levels, has long been considered a stylized fact of local population growth. But throughout U.S. history, local population growth has significantly deviated from it. Across small locations, growth was strongly negatively correlated with initial population throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This strong convergence gave way to moderate divergence beginning in the mid-twentieth century. Across intermediate and large locations, growth became moderately positively correlated with initial population starting in the late nineteenth century. This divergence eventually dissipated but never completely. A simple-one sector model combining the entry of new locations, a friction from population growth, and a decrease in the congestion arising from the supply of land closely matches these and a number of other evolving empirical relationships.},

abstract = {This paper studies the implementation of land use regulations in urban China. In particular, we investigate land developers' compliance with floor-to-area ratio (FAR) regulations using a unique set of residential land parcel data from 30 major Chinese cities matched with the corresponding residential development projects built on those parcels. In our sample, in more than 20{\%} of the cases, developers built above the regulatory FAR limits in the ex post land development, and the total floor area built in those cases increased 21.5{\%} over the regulatory limit. Our analysis finds that attractive land location attributes tend to induce developers to pursue upward adjustments of FAR. Moreover, developers who are more likely to have special relationships with government officials tend to make larger upward adjustments. Our estimates suggest that there exists a significant gap between the privately optimal FAR that maximizes land value and the regulatory FAR. This gap is only modestly reduced by corrupt ties with government officials, implying that FAR regulations have imposed a highly restrictive constraint on China's urban land development even given imperfect compliance.},

Using a new dataset covering over 250,000 randomly selected potential city locations, and all actual cities during the period 800–1800, we disentangle the different roles of geography in shaping today's European city system. We find that a location's physical geography characteristics are the dominant determinants of its urban chances. Preferential location for water- or land-based transportation is a particularly important city seed. In addition, a location's position relative to already-existing cities matters for its urban chances. Interestingly, it does so in a way corresponding to predictions from economic geography theory.},

abstract = {Many cities in developing economies, particularly in Africa, are experiencing ‘urbanization without industrialization'. This paper conceptualizes this in a framework in which a city can produce non-tradable goods and – if it is sufficiently competitive – also internationally tradable goods, potentially subject to increasing returns to scale. A city is unlikely to produce tradables if it faces high urban and hinterland demand for non-tradables, or high costs of urban infrastructure and construction. The paper shows that, if there are increasing returns in tradable production, there may be multiple equilibria. The same initial conditions can support dichotomous outcomes, with cities either in a low-level (non-tradable only) equilibrium, or diversified in both tradable and non-tradable production. We demonstrate the importance of history and of expectations in determining outcomes. Essentially, a city can be built in a manner which makes it difficult to attract tradable production. This might be a consequence of low (and self-fulfilling expectations) or of history. Predictions of the model are consistent with a number of observed features of African cities.},

abstract = {How does intercity passenger transportation shape urban employment and specialization patterns? To shed light on this question I study China's High Speed Railway (HSR), an unprecedentedly large-scale network that connected 81 cities from 2003 to 2014 with trains running at speeds over 200 km/h. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I find that an HSR connection increases city-wide passenger flows by 10{\%} and employment by 7{\%}. To deal with the issues of endogenous railway placement and simultaneous public investments accompanying HSR connection, I examine the impact of a city's market access changes purely driven by the HSR connection of other cities. The estimates suggest that HSR-induced expansion in market access increases urban employment with an elasticity between 2 and 2.5. Further evidence on sectoral employment suggests that industries with a higher reliance on nonroutine cognitive skills benefit more from HSR-induced market access to other cities.},

Properly designing and assessing housing policies in China or elsewhere requires knowing the price and income elasticities of housing demand. While demand elasticities for housing have been much studied around the globe, relatively few studies have estimated housing elasticities in formerly planned economies. We use the unusually rich data from the 1991 to 2006 Chinese Health and Nutrition Surveys to estimate that in China's renewed market phase the permanent income elasticity of housing services demand in China is.70 and the elasticity of housing services demand with respect to the price of space is −.64. We also estimate that in China the own-price and income elasticities of the demand for habitable space are −.38 and.29, respectively.},

abstract = {Developing countries have urbanized rapidly since 1950. To explain urbanization, standard models emphasize rural–urban migration, focusing on rural push factors (agricultural modernization and rural poverty) and urban pull factors (industrialization and urban-biased policies). Using new historical data on urban birth and death rates for 7 countries from Industrial Europe (1800–1910) and 35 developing countries (1960–2010), we argue that a non-negligible part of developing countries' rapid urban growth and urbanization may also be linked to demographic factors, i.e. rapid internal urban population growth, or an urban push. High urban natural increase in today's developing countries follows from lower urban mortality, relative to Industrial Europe, where higher urban deaths offset urban births. This compounds the effects of migration and displays strong associations with urban congestion, providing additional insight into the phenomenon of urbanization without growth.},

In particular, we study the impact of providing better houses in situ to slum dwellers in El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay. We experimentally evaluate the impact of a housing project run by the NGO TECHO (“roof”), which provides basic pre-fabricated houses to members of extremely poor population groups in Latin America. The main objective of the program is to improve household well-being. Our findings show that better houses have a positive effect on overall housing conditions and general well-being: the members of treated households are happier with their quality of life. In two countries, we also document improvements in children's health; in El Salvador, slum dwellers who have received the TECHO houses also feel that they are safer. We do not find this result, however, in the other two experimental samples. There are no other noticeable robust effects in relation to the possession of durable goods or labor outcomes. Our results are robust in terms of both their internal and external validity because they are derived from similar experiments in three different Latin American countries.},

abstract = {Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980–2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although ­human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerablysmaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestlycontribute to these differences.

Skill agglomerations are then considered to explain this. Specifically, if men and women employ heteroge-neous skills, and these skills have differential productivities across city sizes, agglomerative forces may differentially reward men and women. Occupational data show that women are concentrated in jobs relatively more intensive in interactive and cognitive skills, while men are comparatively in physical skill-intensive jobs. Decomposing the gender wage gap shows that explanatory factors (edu-cation, skills, and location) predict women would outearn men. Instead, agglomerative skill returns account for majority of the gap. These estimates suggest that even as women employ skills rewarded in agglomeration economies, they benefit less from agglomerations than men, resulting in the observed gap.},

However, if incoming foreign investors borrow heavily from domestic banks, multinational firms may exacerbate financing constraints by crowding host-country firms out of domestic capital markets. Combining a unique cross-country firm-level panel with time-series data on restrictions on international transactions and capital flows, we find that different measures of global flows are associated with a reduction in firm-level financing constraints. First, we show that one type of capital inflow-direct foreign investment (DFI)-is associated with a reduction in financing constraints. Second, we show that restrictions on capital account transactions negatively affect firms' financing constraints. We also show that DFI inflows are associated with lower sensitivity of investment to cash flow for firms without foreign assets and for domestically owned enterprises. Finally, the results indicate that these effects are stronger for low-income than for high-income regions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Our new index directly incorporates the location of individual establishments while controlling for the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) in order to create this measure of spatial similarity between two industries. We estimate that proximity to transportation infrastructure and consumers as well as knowledge spillovers largely explain patterns of agglomeration.

Nonetheless, economists also recognize the production advantages of urban density in the form of positive agglomeration externalities. The long-run equilibrium outcomes in economies with multiple correlated but offsetting externalities have yet to be fully explored in the literature. Therefore, I develop a spatial equilibrium model of urban structure that includes both congestion costs and agglomeration externalities. I then estimate the structural parameters of the model using a computational algorithm to match the spatial distribution of employment, population, land use, land rents, and commute times in the data. Policy simulations based on the estimates suggest that congestion pricing may have ambiguous consequences for economic welfare.},

This view is not supported by the data. We extend the canonical model with an additional sector producing non-tradable goods which benefits from localized knowledge spillovers coming from the R{\&}D performing industrial sector. This view, motivated by the evidence, generates both an anti-growth and a pro-growth effect of agglomeration for both the deindustrializing and the industrializing regions and leads to two novel results: (1) when agglomeration takes place, growth is lower in the periphery; (2) agglomeration may have a negative effect on the growth rate of real income, both at the regional and at the aggregate level. Our conclusions have relevant policy implications: contrary to the standard view, current EU and US regional policies favouring industrial dispersion might be welfare-improving both at the regional and the aggregate level and may reduce regional income disparities.},

abstract = {The unemployment gender gap, defined as the difference between female and male unemploy- ment rates, was positive until 1980. This gap virtually disappeared after 1980, except during recessions when men's unemployment rate always exceeds women's. We study the evolution of these gender differences in unemployment from a long-run perspective and over the business cycle. Using a calibrated three-state search model of the labor market, we show that the rise in female labor force attachment and the decline in male attachment can mostly account for the closing of the gender unemployment gap. Evidence from nineteen OECD countries also supports the notion that convergence in attachment is associated with a decline in the gender unemploy- ment gap. At the cyclical frequency, we find that gender differences in industry composition are important in recessions, especially the most recent, but they do not explain gender differences in employment growth during recoveries.},

@book{Sandmo2015,
abstract = {This chapter considers the history of theories of income distribution, from the time of Adam Smith until the 1970s. It is divided into two main parts. Part I considers the positive theory of income distribution, beginning with the classical economists' analysis of the functional distribution of income between wages, profits, and rent. It goes on to present the new theories that emerged with the marginalist revolution and which were based on maximizing behavior and market equilibrium. The main focus during the early stages of the new developments was on the markets for consumer goods and the role of marginal utility in price determination. The later neoclassical economists, including Alfred Marshall and Knut Wicksell, paid more attention to the special features that characterized the labor market and the role of marginal productivity in wage formation. In the twentieth century, the neoclassical theory was extended to include analysis of the role of imperfect competition, human capital, and risk-taking. Also included in this part of the chapter is a discussion of statistical and institutional approaches. Part II covers normative theories of income distribution and their implications for redistributive policy. It begins with a consideration of the value judgments implicit in the policy recommendations of the classical economists and continues with the attempts to establish an analytical foundation for welfare economics. The rise of Paretian welfare theory with its emphasis on the impossibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding income redistribution, but the older utilitarian approach, including equal sacrifice theories, continued to live on in the modern analysis of optimal redistribution. A short Part III contains some concluding reflections on the position of income distribution theory within economics as a whole.},

To analyze labor supply in a world with market frictions, we propose and solve a macro model of the labor market with unemployment and labor force participation as endogenous and distinct states. In our world, workers' decisions of participating are determined by an entry decision and an exit decision. A calibration of the model improves the usual representations of labor markets, since it quantitatively accounts for the observed flows between employment and nonparticipation. The paper investigates also the effect of payroll taxes and unemployment benefits on participation decisions. Taxes reduce entries and increase exits, whereas unemployment benefits, at a given job-finding rate, raise entries and have ambiguous effects on exits.},

abstract = {The modern economic role of women emerged in four phases. The first three were evolutionary; the last was revolutionary. Phase I occurred from the late nineteenth century to the 1920s; Phase II was from 1930 to 1950; Phase III extended from 1950 to the late 1970s; and Phase IV, the "quiet revolution," began in the late 1970s and is still ongoing. Three aspects of women's choices distinguish the evolutionary from the revolutionary phases: horizon, identity, and decision-making. The evolutionary phases are apparent in time-series data on labor force participation. The revolutionary phase is discernible using time-series evidence on women's more predictable attachment to the workplace, greater identity with career, and better ability to make joint decisions with their spouses. Each of these series has a sharp break or inflection point signifying social and economic change. These changes, moreover, coincide by birth cohort or period. The relationship between the development of modern labor economics and the reality of women's changing economic role is explored. The paper concludes by assessing whether the revolution has stalled or is being reversed. Women who graduated college in the early 1980s did not "opt-out,"but recent cohorts are too young to evaluate.},

We discuss the measurement of wage inequality, data sources, and stylized facts of wage dispersion for rich countries. The literature explaining the dispersion of wage rates and the role of institutions is evaluated, from the early 1980s to the recent literature on job polarization and tasks as well as on the minimum wage. Distinguishing between supply-and-demand approaches and institutional ones, we find supply and demand challenged by the empirical measurement of technological change and a risk of ad hoc additions, without realizing their institutional preconditions. The institutional approach faces an abundance of institutions without a clear conceptual delineation of institutions and their interactions. Empirical cross-country analysis of the correlation between institutional measures and wage inequality incorporates unemployment and working hours dynamics, discussing the problems of matching individuals to their relevant institutional framework. Minimum wage legislation and active labor market policies come out negatively correlated to earnings inequality in US and EU countries.},

Rising income inequality has attracted the attention of the U.S. President, of international bodies such as the IMF and the OECD, and of participants in the Davos meeting. This volume of the Handbook aims to cover the advances made in the past 15 years in our understanding of the extent, causes, and consequences of inequality. In this respect, the second volume should be seen as complementing, not supplanting, the first volume. We have encouraged authors to concentrate on the developments that have taken place since 2000, and the chapters should be read in conjunction with those in volume I.

abstract = {Gender wage and employment gaps are negatively correlated across countries. We argue that non-random selection of women into work explains an important part of such correlation and thus of the observed variation in wage gaps. The idea is that, if women who are employed tend to have relatively high-wage characteristics, low female employment rates may become consistent with low gender wage gaps simply because low-wage women would not feature in the observed wage distribution. We explore this idea across the US and EU countries estimating gender gaps in potential wages. We recover information on wages for those not in work in a given year using alternative imputation techniques. Imputation is based on (i) wage observations from other waves in the sample, (ii) observable characteristics of the non employed, and (iii) a statistical repeated-sampling model. We then estimate median wage gaps on the resulting imputed wage distributions, thus simply requiring assumptions on the position of the imputed wage observations with respect to the median, but not on their level. We obtain higher median wage gaps on imputed rather than actual wage distributions for most countries in the sample. However, this difference is small in the US, the UK and most central and northern EU countries, and becomes sizeable in Ireland, France and southern EU, all countries in which gender employment gaps are high. In particular, correction for employment selection explains more than a half of the observed correlation between wage and employment gaps.},

Furthermore, this proportion does not go down as much as one might think for smaller or slower-growing metropolitan areas, or for college-educated persons. These findings imply that state and local investments in children may pay off for the state or local area that makes these investments.

We do not find evidence that the impoverished residents benefited from the program. Our findings are consistent with the areas becoming more attractive to high-income households. The improvements in the areas were concentrated in those portions of each zone that were relatively better-off prior to EZ designation. The results confirm the prior literature findings that the areas, on average, became more attractive but also suggest that the benefits of the program likely did not accrue to the lower-income residents of the EZ areas.},

@book{Acemoglu2015,
abstract = {In this paper we revisit the relationship between democracy, redistribution, and inequality. We first explain the theoretical reasons why democracy is expected to increase redistribution and reduce inequality, and why this expectation may fail to be realized when democracy is captured by the richer segments of the population; when it caters to the preferences of the middle class; or when it opens up disequalizing opportunities to segments of the population previously excluded from such activities, thus exacerbating inequality among a large part of the population. We then survey the existing empirical literature, which is both voluminous and full of contradictory results. We provide new and systematic reduced-form evidence on the dynamic impact of democracy on various outcomes. Our findings indicate that there is a significant and robust effect of democracy on tax revenues as a fraction of GDP, but no robust impact on inequality. We also find that democracy is associated with an increase in secondary schooling and a more rapid structural transformation. Finally, we provide some evidence suggesting that inequality tends to increase after democratization when the economy has already undergone significant structural transformation, when land inequality is high, and when the gap between the middle class and the poor is small. All of these are broadly consistent with a view that is different from the traditional median voter model of democratic redistribution: democracy does not lead to a uniform decline in post-tax inequality, but can result in changes in fiscal redistribution and economic structure that have ambiguous effects on inequality.},

abstract = {The modern formulation of equality of opportunity emerges from discussions in political philosophy from the second half of the twentieth century beginning with Rawls (1971) and Dworkin (1981a,b). Equality of opportunity exists when policies compensate individuals with disadvantageous circumstances so that outcomes experienced by a population depend only on factors for which persons can be considered to be responsible. Importantly, inequality of opportunity for income exists when individuals' incomes are in some important part determined by the educational achievement and income of the families that raised them. We review the philosophical debates referred to, commenting upon them from an economist's viewpoint. We propose several ways of modeling equality (or inequality) of opportunity, pointing out that an equal-opportunity ethic implies a non-welfarist way of ranking social outcomes. We propose that economic development should be conceived of as the equalization of opportunities for income in a country. We consider equalization of opportunity from a dynamic viewpoint, and we review popular attitudes with regard to distributive justice, showing that there is substantial popular support for an equal-opportunity ethic. We discuss the empirical issues that emerge in measuring inequality of opportunity and provide a review of the empirical literature that measures degrees of inequality of opportunity for the achievement of various objectives, in various countries.},

We distinguish three approaches: the capability (and functionings) approach, the use of subjective life satisfaction measures, and the calculation of equivalent incomes. We discuss the normative assumptions underlying these three approaches, focusing on two issues: the degree to which individual preferences are respected and where in each approach the boundaries of individual responsibility are drawn. We compare the measurement of inequality in well-being with the use of multidimensional inequality measures. We illustrate the general theoretical issues in three domains of application: measuring the effects of household size and composition in the literature on equivalence scales, valuing publicly provided goods and services, and making international comparisons of well-being involving international purchasing power parity comparisons.},

@book{Ravallion2015,
abstract = {How did we come to think that eliminating poverty is a legitimate goal for public policy? What policies emerged in the hope of attaining that goal? The last 200 years have witnessed a dramatic change in thinking about poverty. Mainstream economic thinking in the eighteenth century held that poverty was necessary and even desirable for a country's economic success. Today, poverty is more often viewed as a constraint on that success. In short, poverty switched from being seen as a social good to a social bad. This change in thinking, and the accompanying progress in knowledge, has greatly influenced public action, with heightened emphasis on the role of antipoverty policy in sustainable promotion from poverty, as well as protection. Development strategies today typically strive for a virtuous cycle of growth with equity and a range of policy interventions have emerged to help ensure that outcome. An expanding body of knowledge has taught us about how effective those interventions are in specific settings, although many knowledge gaps remain.},

Wealth-income ratios, inherited wealth, and wealth inequalities were high in the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries up until World War I, then sharply dropped during the twentieth century following World War shocks, and have been rising again in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We discuss the models that can account for these facts. We show that over a wide range of models, the long-run magnitude and concentration of wealth and inheritance are an increasing function of r--g where r- is the net-of-tax rate of return on wealth and g is the economy's growth rate. This suggests that current trends toward rising wealth-income ratios and wealth inequality might continue during the twenty-first century, both because of the slowdown of population and productivity growth, and because of rising international competition to attract capital.},

In doing so they miss an important element of the distribution of welfare that can vary dramatically depending on overall environmental and economic factors. Thus, measures of inequality that ignore intrahousehold allocations are both incomplete and misleading. We discuss determinants of intrahousehold allocation of resources and welfare. We show how the sharing rule, which characterizes the within-household allocations, can be identified from data on household consumption and labor supply. We also argue that a measure based on estimates of the sharing rule is inadequate as an approach that seeks to understand how welfare is distributed in the population because it ignores public goods and the allocation of time to market work, leisure, and household production. We discuss a money metric alternative, that fully characterizes the utility level reached by the agent. We then review the current literature on the estimation of the sharing rule based on a number of approaches, including the use of distribution factors as well as preference restrictions.},

abstract = {We examine the relationship between income and health with the purpose of establishing the extent to which the distribution of health in a population contributes to income inequality and is itself a product of that inequality. The evidence supports a substantial impact of ill-health on income, mainly operating through employment, although the magnitude of ill-health's contribution to income inequality is difficult to gauge. Variation in exposure to health risks early in life could be an important mechanism through which health may generate and possibly sustain economic inequality. If material advantage can be exercised within the domain of health, then economic inequality will generate health inequality. In high-income countries, the evidence that income (wealth) does have a causal impact on health in adulthood is weak. But this may simply reflect the difficulty of identifying a relationship that, should it exist, is likely to emerge over a lifetime as poor material living conditions slowly take their toll on health. There is little credible evidence to support the claim that the economic inequality in society threatens the health of all its members or that relative income is a determinant of health.},

abstract = {This chapter provides a thorough survey of what recent international (i.e., cross-country) studies can tell us about the multiple causes of income inequality in the OECD area with regard to both levels and trends. The survey covers economics literature in particular but also relevant evidence from sociology and political science. We provide an overview of drivers of inequality in six areas: (i) structural macroeconomic sectoral changes, (ii) globalization and technology change, (iii) labor market and other relevant institutions, (iv) politics and political processes, (v) tax/transfer schemes, and (vi) demographic and other microstructural changes. We find that the literature, while extremely rich in partial analysis of all six areas, provides very few analyses with truly multivariate and multicountry specifications for the joint section of the OECD and EU countries. Suggestions include more cross-discipline reflections on various findings. This is now well facilitated by the spectacular development of data, as well as in relation to methodological harmonization across disciplines.},

There is no need for central government intervention. If households are attached to particular regions for cultural or nationalistic reasons, however, at least one of two regions undersupplies the public good.

In contrast, the data support the cross-equation restrictions which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for efficient sorting.},

abstract = {I examine the causes and the consequences of differences in labor market outcomes across local labor markets within a country. The focus is on a long-run general equilibrium setting, where workers and firms are free to move across localities and local prices adjust to maintain the spatial equilibrium. In particular, I develop a tractable general equilibrium framework of local labor markets with heterogenous labor. This framework is useful in thinking about differences in labor market outcomes of different skill groups across locations. It clarifies how, in spatial equilibrium, localized shocks to a part of the labor market propagate to the rest of the economy through changes in employment, wages and local prices and how this diffusion affects workers' welfare. Using this framework, I address three related questions. First, I analyze the welfare consequences of productivity differences across local labor markets. I seek to understand what happens to the wage, employment and utility of workers with different skill levels when a local economy experiences a shift in the productivity of a group of workers. Second, I analyze the causes of productivity differences across local labor markets. To a large extent, productivity differences within a country are unlikely to be exogenous. I review the theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration economies, with a particular focus on studies that are relevant for labor economists. Finally, I discuss the implications for policy.},

abstract = {This chapter surveys existing approaches to modeling labor supply and identifies important gaps in the literature that could be addressed in future research. The discussion begins with a look at recent policy reforms and labor market facts that motivate the study of labor supply. The analysis then presents a unifying framework that allows alternative empirical formulations of the labor supply model to be compared and their resulting elasticities to be interpreted. This is followed by critical reviews of alternative approaches to labor-supply modeling. The first review assesses the difference-in-differences approach and its relationship to natural experiments. The second analyzes estimation with non-linear budget constraints and welfare-program participation. The third appraises developments of family labor-supply models including both the standard unitary and collective labor-supply formulations. The fourth briefly explores dynamic extensions of the labor supply model, characterizing how participation decisions, learning-by-doing, human capital accumulation and habit formation affect the analysis of the lifecycle model. At the end of each of the four broad reviews, we summarize a selection of the recent empirical findings. The concluding section asks whether the developments reviewed in this chapter place us in a better position to answer the policy-reform questions and to interpret the trends in participation and hours with which we began this review. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using two large datasets, the National Survey of Families and Households and the public use files of the U.S. Census, we find that the predicted probability of employment and labor force participation is 4-10 percentage points higher for married women with young children living in close proximity to their mothers or their mothers-in-law compared with those living further away. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this essay, we review the basic economics of housing supply and the functioning of US housing markets to better understand the distribution of home prices, household wealth and the spatial distribution of people across markets. We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. Of course, poorer households still may have very high housing cost burdens that society may wish to address via transfers. But if housing prices are above this cost in a given area, then the housing market is not functioning well—and housing is too expensive for all households in the market, not just for poorer ones. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax, which might be efficiently incorporating the negative externalities of new production, but typical estimates find that the implicit tax is far higher than most reasonable estimates of those externalities.},

Separating these positive and negative effects is a central challenge in understanding the role of industries and pollution in shaping city growth. To make progress on this issue, this paper introduces a model incorporating endogenous disamenities related to industrial pollution into a standard urban framework. I then propose a new theoretically-grounded estimation strategy that can be used to separate the positive direct effect of employment growth in polluting industries on overall city employment from the negative indirect effect that occurs through the pollution these industries generate. This strategy is applied to study the influence of industrial pollution on the long-run growth of British cities from 1851-1911, the first widespread episode of modern industrial pollution. My results suggest that coal-based pollution substantially impeded the growth of British cities during this period.},

Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia transfers are viewed as an income shock because they alter the income composition in terms of earned and unearned income. The analysis is undertaken using the values of the transfers as the treatment indicator to show how the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) varies according to the amount received. ATT estimates obtained from the Propensity Score Weighting method lead to the conclusion that PBF marginally diminishes the supply of weekly work hours of working adults. The heterogeneous impacts of the cash transfers on men and women depending upon how they are placed in formal and informal sectors, agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and wage rate ranges are also assessed. The results indicate a nil average effect on probability of working and a marginal reduction in the supply of labour hours for men and women.

Although male and female MBAs have nearly identical earnings at the outset of their careers, their earnings soon diverge, with the male earnings advantage reaching almost 60 log points a decade after MBA completion. Three proximate factors account for the large and rising gender gap in earnings: differences in training prior to MBA graduation, differences in career interruptions, and differences in weekly hours. The greater career discontinuity and shorter work hours for female MBAs are largely associated with motherhood. (JEL J16, J22, J31, J44)},

abstract = {Many cities in developing economies, particularly in Africa, are experiencing ‘urbanization without industrialization'. This paper conceptualizes this in a framework in which a city can produce non-tradable goods and – if it is sufficiently competitive – also internationally tradable goods, potentially subject to increasing returns to scale. A city is unlikely to produce tradables if it faces high urban and hinterland demand for non-tradables, or high costs of urban infrastructure and construction. The paper shows that, if there are increasing returns in tradable production, there may be multiple equilibria. The same initial conditions can support dichotomous outcomes, with cities either in a low-level (non-tradable only) equilibrium, or diversified in both tradable and non-tradable production. We demonstrate the importance of history and of expectations in determining outcomes. Essentially, a city can be built in a manner which makes it difficult to attract tradable production. This might be a consequence of low (and self-fulfilling expectations) or of history. Predictions of the model are consistent with a number of observed features of African cities.},

It is shown that ties represent negative "personal" externalities which are usually, but not always, internalized by the family. Family ties tend to deter migration, to reduce the employment and earnings of migrating wives, and to increase the employment and earnings of their husbands. The growth of labor market attachment of women creates an increase in migration ties, which both deters migration and contributes to marital instability. Conversely, growing marital instability stimulates migration and reinforces the upward trends in women's labor force participation.},

The effect of these changes depends crucially on the ability of factors to move in response. Therefore a key object of interest for policy evaluation and design is the elasticity of local employment to these changes in the economic environment. We develop a quantitative general equilibrium model that incorporates spatial linkages between locations in goods markets (trade) and factor markets (commuting and migration). We find substantial heterogeneity across locations in local employment elasticities. We show that this heterogeneity can be well explained with theoretically motivated measures of commuting flows. Without taking into account this dependence, estimates of the local employment elasticity for one location are not generalizable to other locations. We also find that commuting flows and their importance cannot be accounted for with standard measures of size or wages at the county or commuting zone levels.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This paper seeks to reconcile these two approaches by developing a novel theoretical framework that explicitly models unemployment and wage determination while featuring both constrained e¢ ciency and a microfounded aggregate production function. The framework delivers a uni{\ldots}ed aggregate production and matching function that incorporates unemployment. In general, the coexistence of both matching frictions and heterogeneity in {\ldots}rm productivities (which are private information) means that {\ldots}rms are paid both productivity rents and matching rents.

abstract = {Individual outcomes are highly correlated with group average outcomes, a fact often interpreted as a causal peer effect. Without covariates, however, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, either unity or, if the average is defined as a leave-out mean, determined by a generic intraclass correlation coefficient. When pre-determined peer characteristics are introduced as covariates in a model linking individual outcomes with group averages, the question of whether peer effects or social spillovers exist is econometrically identical to that of whether a 2SLS estimator using group dummies to instrument individual characteristics differs from OLS estimates of the effect of these characteristics. The interpretation of results from models that rely solely on chance variation in peer groups is therefore complicated by bias from weak instruments. With systematic variation in group composition, the weak IV issue falls away, but the resulting 2SLS estimates can be expected to exceed the corresponding OLS estimates as a result of measurement error and for other reasons unrelated to social effects. Research designs that manipulate peer characteristics in a manner unrelated to individual characteristics provide the most compelling evidence on the nature of social spillovers. As an empirical matter, designs of this sort have mostly uncovered little in the way of socially significant causal effects.},

@article{Donaldson2016,
abstract = {P hotographic images of the Earth from above have been recorded since the late 19th century, initially by cameras attached to balloons, kites, or pigeons. This remotely sensed information has been used for economic analysis since at least the 1930s; for example, Monmonier (2002) discusses how several dozen photographic crews started flying over US farmland in the 1930s to study produc-tion and conservation, and by 1941 had recorded images of more than 90 percent of total acreage. However, the past decade or so has seen a dramatic change in the way that economists can learn by watching our planet from above. A revolu-tion has taken place in remote sensing and allied fields such as computer science, engineering, and geography. Petabytes of satellite imagery have become publicly accessible at increasing resolution, many algorithms for extracting meaningful social science information from these images are now routine, and modern cloud-based processing power allows these algorithms to be run at global scale. This paper seeks to introduce economists to the science of remotely sensed data, and to give a flavor of how this new source of data has been used by economists so far and what might be done in the future. We group the main advantages of such remote sensing data to economists into three categories: 1) access to information difficult to obtain by other means; 2) unusually high spatial resolution; and 3) wide geographic coverage. The first advantage is simply that remote sensing technologies can collect panel data at low marginal cost, repeatedly, and at large scale on proxies for a wide range of hard-to-measure characteristics. We discuss below economic analysis that already uses remotely sensed data on night lights, precipitation, wind speed, flooding, topography, forest cover, crop choice, agricultural productivity, urban development, building type, roads, pollution, beach quality, and fish abundance. Many more char-acteristics of potential interest to economists have already been measured remotely and used in other fields. Most of these variables would be prohibitively expensive to measure accurately without remote sensing, and there are settings in which the official government counterparts of some remotely sensed statistics (such as pollu-tion or forestry) may be subject to manipulation. As an example of this first advantage, access to previously unavailable data, consider Burgess et al. (2012), who study deforestation in Indonesia. Forestry is highly regulated in Indonesia, but local officials are sometimes bribed to over-look illegal logging. Thus, administrative statistics, produced in collaboration with such officials, are subject to concerns about misreporting. Satellite data allowed Burgess et al. (2012) to measure deforestation—an example of which can be seen in Figure 1—in an objective manner, and thereby to shed new light on the political economy of natural resource appropriation. Consistent with Cournot competi-tion across jurisdictions, these authors find that each additional district created in a province induces an 8.2 percent increase in the province's deforestation rate. In principle, with higher spatial and temporal resolution, enough satellites and improved algorithms, future work could track forest cover or agricultural output (even at the level of individual plots) globally. Figure 2 illustrates a second example where novel satellite data made an important study possible. Jayachandran (2009) estimates the impact of air pollu-tion (particulate matter) resulting from Indonesia's devastating late-1997 forest fire on infant and fetal mortality. Using daily satellite sensor readings about airborne smoke and dust, Jayachandran measures the spread of pollution and estimated that this two-month event caused 16,400 infant and fetal deaths. New technologies are already being developed in order to measure other pollutants such as methane, a major greenhouse gas, perhaps even with the ability to resolve individual plumes. The second advantage of remote sensing data sources is that they are typically available at a substantially higher degree of spatial resolution than are traditional data. Much of the publicly available satellite imagery used by economists provides readings for each of the hundreds of billions of 30-meter-by-30-meter grid cells of land surface on Earth. Many economic decisions (particularly land use decisions such as zoning, building types, or crop choice) are made at approximately this same level of spatial resolution. But since 1999, private companies have offered submeter imagery and, following a 2014 US government ruling, American companies are able to sell imagery at resolutions below 0.5 meters to nongovernment customers for the first time. This is important because even when a coarser unit of analysis is appropriate, 900 1-meter pixels provide far more information available for signal extraction than a single 30-meter pixel covering the same area.

To address the endogeneity, we exploit the presence of additional variables. Like conventional instrumental variables, these variables are correlated with the endogenous regressor. However, unlike conventional instrumental variables, they also have direct effects on the outcome, and thus are “invalid” instruments. Our novel identifying assumption is that the direct effects of these invalid instruments are uncorrelated with the effects of the instruments on the endogenous regressor. We show that in this case the limited-information-maximum-likelihood (liml) estimator is no longer consistent, but that a modification of the bias-corrected two-stage-least-square (tsls) estimator is consistent. We also show that conventional tests for over-identifying restrictions, adapted to the many instruments setting, can be used to test for the presence of these direct effects. We recommend that empirical researchers carry out such tests and compare estimates based on liml and the modified version of bias-corrected tsls. We illustrate in the context of two applications that such practice can be illuminating, and that our novel identifying assumption has substantive empirical content.},

There generally exists no closed-form solution for such problems. As such, we must result to numerical and/or approximation techniques. One particularly easy and very common approximation technique is that of log linearization. We first take natural logs of the system of non-linear difference equations. We then linearize the logged difference equations about a particular point (usually a steady state), and simplify until we have a system of linear difference equations where the variables of interest are percentage deviations about a point (again, usually a steady state). Linearization is nice because we know how to work with linear difference equations. Putting things in percentage terms (that's the " log " part) is nice because it provides natural interpretations of the units (i.e. everything is in percentage terms). second derivative evaluated at the same point, f (3) is the third derivative, and so on. n! reads " n factorial " and is equal to n! = n(n − 1)(n − 2) {\textperiodcentered} ... {\textperiodcentered} 1.

abstract = {In this paper, we first describe the 1990 DEED, the most recently constructed matched employeremployee data set for the United States that contains detailed demographic information on workers (most notably, information on education). We then use the data from manufacturing establishments in the 1990 DEED to update and expand on previous findings, using a more limited data set, regarding the measurement of the labor input and theories of wage determination (Hellerstein, et al., 1999). We find that the productivity of women is less than that of men, but not by enough to fully explain the gap in wages, a result that is consistent with wage discrimination against women. In contrast, we find no evidence of wage discrimination against blacks. We estimate that both the wage and productivity profiles are rising but concave to the origin (consistent with profiles quadratic in age), but the estimated relative wage profile is steeper than the relative productivity profile, consistent with models of deferred wages. We find a productivity premium for marriage equal to that of the wage premium, and a productivity premium for education that somewhat exceeds the wage premium. Exploring the sensitivity of these results, we also find that different specifications of production functions do not have any qualitative effects on the these results. Finally, the results indicate that the returns to productive inputs (capital, materials, labor quality) as well as the residual variance are virtually unaffected by the choice of the construction of the labor quality input.

abstract = {While neoclassical theory emphasizes the impact of trade on wage inequality between occupations and sectors, more recent theories of firm heterogeneity point to the impact of trade on wage dispersion within occupations and sectors. Using linked employer-employee data for Brazil, we show that much of overall wage inequality arises within sector-occupations and for workers with similar observable characteristics; this within component is driven by wage dispersion between firms; and wage dispersion between firms is related to firm employment size and trade participation. We then extend the heterogenous-firm model of trade and inequality from Helpman, Itskhoki and Redding (2010) and structurally estimate it with Brazilian data. We show that the estimated model fits the data well, both in terms of key moments as well as in terms of the overall distributions of wages and employment, and find that international trade is important for this fit. In the estimated model, reductions in trade costs have a sizeable effect on wage inequality.},

Composition also affects organizations themselves, including their performance, hiring and promotion practices, levels of job segregation, and wages and benefits.

Through a case-study approach, the discussion is centered on the multiple dualities of the local labor market determined by gender, place, migration, and the rural-urban divide. Although the empirical findings on gender differentiation in Chinese labor markets validate the conclusions of labor-market segmentation theory in general, they also point to the uniqueness of the segmentation processes of the Chinese labor market during the course of its economic transition since the reform. In this study we find that both place and space play an important role in configuring labor market segments, and the spatial construction of local labor markets is shaped greatly by the rural-urban social structure as defined by the household-registration system.},

We compare American metropolitan areas with analogous geographic units in Brazil, China and India. Both Gibrat's Law and Zipf's Law seem to hold as well in Brazil as in the U.S., but China and India look quite different. In Brazil and China, the implications of the spatial equilibrium hypothesis, the central organizing idea of urban economics, are not rejected. The India data, however, repeatedly rejects tests inspired by the spatial equilibrium assumption. One hypothesis is that spatial equilibrium only emerges with economic development, as markets replace social relationships and as human capital spreads more widely. In all four countries there is strong evidence of agglomeration economies and human capital externalities. The correlation between density and earnings is stronger in both China and India than in the U.S., strongest in China. In India the gap between urban and rural wages is huge, but the correlation between city size and earnings is more modest. The cross-sectional relationship between area-level skills and both earnings and area-level growth are also stronger in the developing world than in the U.S. The forces that drive urban success seem similar in the rich and poor world, even if limited migration and difficult housing markets make it harder for a spatial equilibrium to develop.},

While schooling increased and child labor declined in rural India in the 1990s, these trends are attenuated in districts with employment concentrated in industries losing tariff protection. As the loss of protection causes a relative rise in poverty in affected districts, families reduce schooling to save schooling costs. Girls disproportionately bear the burden of helping their families cope with poverty.},

abstract = {The converging roles of men and women are among the grandest advances in society and the economy in the last century. These aspects of the grand gender convergence are figurative chapters in a history of gender roles. But what must the “last” chapter contain for there to be equality in the labor market? The answer may come as a surprise. The solution does not (necessarily) have to involve government intervention and it need not make men more responsible in the home (although that wouldn't hurt). But it must involve changes in the labor market, especially how jobs are structured and remunerated to enhance temporal flexibility. The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours. Such change has taken off in various sectors, such as technology, science, and health, but is less apparent in the corporate, financial, and legal worlds. (JEL J3, J16, J22, J24, J31, J33, N3)},

For this purpose, we construct an opportunity index that modifies the Human Opportunity Index proposed in the literature and used in Barros et al. (2009) to measure inequality in basic opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Specifically, we construct an opportunity measure that includes not only attendance but also parental choice not to enroll children in daycare or preschool, using data from a supplementary questionnaire included in the 2006 version of Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios (PNAD). The results show that there are large differences between our opportunity index and the Human Opportunity Index for children aged 0-3 years old and considerably smaller differences for children aged 4-6 years old, which suggests that preschool may be closer to a basic opportunity than daycare.},

A simple supply and demand framework is used to analyze changes in the U. S. wage structure from 1963 to 1987. Rapid secular growth in the demand for more-educated workers, "more-skilled" workers, and females appears to be the driving force behind observed changes in the wage structure. Measured changes in the allocation of labor between industries and occupations strongly favored college graduates and females throughout the period. Movements in the college wage premium over this period appear to be strongly related to fluctuations in the rate of growth of the supply of college graduates.},

This assumption implies that households pool their income and, therefore, the ownership of nonwage income has no effect on household demand. In this paper, this implication is tested by estimating multi-sector labor supply equations for men and women in Brazil. The results indicate that the unitary model is rejected in the informal and self-employment sectors for men and the formal and informal sectors for women; in these cases own nonwage income has a significantly negative effect on labor supply while spousal nonwage income has no significant effect.},

But with technological change, gains in youth employment may be offset by less adaptability and diminished employment later in life. To test for this trade-off, we employ a difference-in-differences approach that compares employment rates across different ages for people with general and vocational education. Using micro data for 11 countries from IALS, we find strong and robust support for such a trade-off, especially in countries emphasizing apprenticeship programs. German Microcensus data and Austrian administrative data confirm the results for within-occupational-group analysis and for exogenous variation from plant closures, respectively.},

@article{Soares2002,
abstract = {This paper has three objectives: the first is to track the changes in labor force participation behavior of women and show its evolution according to time and also according to cohorts; the second is to decompose these changes according to a group of elementary variables, such as position in the household and educational level; the last is to analyze with special care the relationship between educational levels of married women, education of their spouses, and their labor force participation behavior. This last objective is motivated by findings in the second one. We have five main results. The first is not surprising — we find both cohort and time effects at work on changes in participation behavior. The second is perhaps more surprising: position in the household has low statistical explanatory power for labor force participation — in other words, the strong increase in the percentage of female headed household holds little relation with the increase in female labor force participation. The real explanation is a massive increase in the participation rates of married women — this increase alone explains close to 70{\%} of the increase in female labor force participation. Another surprising conclusion is that by far the most important explanatory variable is women's educational level, which alone explains about 50{\%} of the variation in the global female participation rate. This suggests a strong price effect in the propensity to work among women. Finally, we van see that for married women of any educational level, increases in the spouse's educational level (and thus potential income) are associated with a lower labor force participation rate. This suggests an income effect to female participation behavior, although other interpretations are possible.},

We focus on cross-city differences in commuting times as a potential explanation for this variation. We start with a model in which commuting times introduce non-convexities into the budget set. Empirical evidence is consistent with the model's predictions: Labor force participation rates of married women are negatively correlated with the metropolitan area commuting time. Also, metropolitan areas with larger increases in average commuting time in 1980-2000 had slower growth in the labor force participation of married women. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We analyze in this chapter the development and evaluation of a new genre of social programs termed conditional cash transfer programs which have become widespread across Latin America and are now extending outside the region. Conditional transfer programs typically link monetary transfers to human capital investment, generally education, health or a combination of both. These transfer programs are considered innovative because they condition the receipt of monetary benefits on such behaviors as regular school attendance and preventive clinic visits. Effectively they are a subsidy to schooling and health, reducing the shadow price of human capital acquisition. We focus here primarily on a case study of Progresa (the Education, Health and Nutrition Program), a Mexican anti-poverty program which has served as a model for the implementation of conditional programs in other countries, and on which most evidence exists on impacts. We also review results from the newer conditional cash transfer programs. The chapter thus analyzes what we know about the success of conditional cash transfer programs as a mechanism for reducing poverty and identifies what research which is still needed in order for broader conclusions to be drawn. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, despite the claims of advocates, no single method dominates; rigorous, policy-relevant evaluations should be open-minded about methodology, adapting to the problem, setting and data constraints. Secondly, future efforts to draw useful lessons from evaluations call for more policy-relevant data and methods than used in the classic assessment of mean impact for those assigned to the program. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@book{Behrman2010,
abstract = {From the point of view of economic development, education is the acquisition of knowledge and skills through experiences from conception onwards over the life cycle that increase productivity broadly defined. Education can occur through, but is not limited to, formal educational activities such as preschool programs, schools, and formal training programs. The proximate determinants of education are experiences or inputs into knowledge and skills production functions. Within a dynamic forward-looking model of human capital investments, these experiences are determined sequentially by a series of family or individual decisions given past, current and expected future resources, markets, policies, and other institutions. The context in which these microinvestment demands are made, in turn, reflects decisions of suppliers of services that are explicitly related to education as well as of options that may be importantly related to education through other experiences, such as in labor markets. To understand the nature of inputs and incentives related to education in developing countries, attention must be paid to both the demand and the supply sides for investments in education, both of which are conditioned significantly by policy choices. Therefore, there are numerous important policy questions related to educational inputs and incentives. What are critical inputs into different educational processes? How important are various incentives for improving these inputs? How effective are various demand-side policies versus supply-side policies? How important are policies that have direct impact on input decisions versus policies that alter longer-run incentives to invest in current education through altering expected longer-run returns from such investments? What are the benefits relative to the resource costs of alternative policies for improving educational inputs? This chapter assesses the current state of empirical knowledge, and gaps in that knowledge, on educational incentives and inputs in developing countries as related to such questions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Orazem2007,
abstract = {In developing countries, rising incomes, increased demand for more skilled labor, and government investments of considerable resources on building and equipping schools and paying teachers have contributed to global convergence in enrollment rates and completed years of schooling. Nevertheless, in many countries substantial education gaps persist between rich and poor, between rural and urban households and between males and females. To address these gaps, some governments have introduced school vouchers or cash transfers programs that are targeted to disadvantaged children. Others have initiated programs to attract or retain students by expanding school access or by setting higher teacher eligibility requirements or increasing the number of textbooks per student. While enrollments have increased, there has not been a commensurate improvement in knowledge and skills of students. Establishing the impact of these policies and programs requires an understanding of the incentives and constraints faced by all parties involved, the school providers, the parents and the children. The chapter reviews the economic literature on the determinants of schooling outcomes and schooling gaps with a focus on static and dynamic household responses to specific policy initiatives, perceived economic returns and other incentives. It discusses measurement and estimation issues involved with empirically testing these models and reviews findings. Governments have increasingly adopted the practice of experimentation and evaluation before taking steps to expand new policies. Often pilot programs are initiated in settings that are atypically appropriate for the program, so that the results overstate the likely impact of expanding the program to other settings. Program expansion can also result in general equilibrium feedback effects that do not apply to isolated pilots. These behavioral models provide a useful context within which to frame the likely outcomes of such expansion. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Rising imports cause higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing manufacturing industries. In our main specification, import competition explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in more trade-exposed labor markets. (JEL E24, F14, F16, J23, J31, L60, O47, R12, R23)},

@article{Notowidigdo2013a,
abstract = {Low-skill workers are comparatively immobile. When labor demand slumps in a city, college-educated workers tend to relocate whereas non-college workers are disproportionately likely to remain to face declining wages and employment. A standard explanation of these facts is that mobility is more costly for low-skill workers. This paper proposes and tests an alternative explanation, which is that the incidence of adverse shocks is borne in large part by (falling) real estate rental prices and (rising) social transfers. These factors reduce the real cost of living differentially for low-income workers and thus compensate them, in part or in full, for declining labor demand. I develop a spatial equilibrium model which, appropriately parameterized, identifies both the magnitude of unobserved mobility costs by skill and the shape of the local housing supply curve. Nonlinear reduced form estimates using U.S. Census data document that positive labor demand shocks increase population more than negative shocks reduce population, that this asymmetry is larger for low-skill workers, and that such an asymmetry is absent for wages, housing values, and rental prices. Estimates of the full model using a nonlinear, simultaneous equations GMM estimator suggest that (1) the asymmetric population response is primarily accounted for by an asymmetric housing supply curve, (2) the differential migration response by skill is primarily accounted for by transfer payments, and (3) estimated mobility costs are at most modest and are comparable for high-skill and low-skill workers, suggesting that the primary explanation for the comparative immobility of low-skilled workers is not higher mobility costs per se, but rather a lower incidence of adverse labor demand shocks.},

Are developing countries justified in imposing tariffs, subsidies, and tax breaks that imply distortions beyond the ones associated with optimal taxes or revenue constraints? We refer to this set of government interventions as "industrial policy." We explore the theoretical foundation for industrial policy and then review the related empirical literature. We follow this with a broader look at the empirical work on the relationship between trade and FDI and growth. In this review we find no support for "hard" interventions that distort prices to deal with Marshallian externalities, learning by exporting, and knowledge spillovers from FDI. Nevertheless, we still envision an important role for what we refer to as "soft" industrial policy. The goal is to develop a process whereby government, industry and cluster-level private organizations can collaborate on interventions to increase productivity. We suggest programs and grants to help particular clusters by improving the formation of skilled workers, technology adoption, regulation and infrastructure. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This chapter surveys a small part of the extensive literature on the linkages among education, productivity, and development, and assesses several areas where concerted research might clarify important issues and potentially change policies. This chapter presents an economic interpretation of this educational explosion. Most of the growth in public expenditures on education is attributed to increases in growth of real income per adult. The chapter describes the expansion of the world's educational system both in terms of its inputs of public and private resources and its output of students, and then estimates how income, price, and population constraints appear to govern this process. The chapter presents a contrast on causal frameworks proposed to explain the relationship between education and productivity, and discusses sources of data to measure the relationship and discriminate among causal interpretations. The chapter reviews evidence on the market returns to schooling measured for entrepreneurs and employees, men and women, and migrants and nonmigrants. The chapter also presents the evidence of schooling's effects on nonmarket production. The chapter discusses the policy issues for development that arise from the apparent effects of education on economic productivity and the mechanisms used to finance and manage the educational system.},

These limitations do not belong to the CGE-class. The inequality constraints and non-distortionary government interventions are justified by external effects or non-convexities. The intertemporal aspects are both under finite and infinite horizons, and the focus of the chapter is on the modeling of money and financial assets.

The enhancement of living conditions must clearly be an essential,if not the essential object of the entire economic exercise and that enhancement is an integral part of the concept of development. Even though the logistic and engineering problems involved in enhancing living conditions in the poor, developing countries might well be very different from those in the rich, developed ones, there is much in common in the respective exercises on the two sides of the divide. The close link between economic development and economic growth is simultaneously a matter of importance as well as a source of considerable confusion. The importance of “growth” must depend on the nature of the variable the expansion of which is considered and seen as “growth.” The chapter discusses a number of different sources of contrast that have to be clearly distinguished from each other, while drawing a distinction between development and growth. The well-being of a person can be seen as an evaluation of the functionings achieved by that person. This approach has been implicitly used by Adam Smith and Karl Marx in particular. The concept of development is by no meansunproblematic. The different problems underlying the concept have become clearer over the years based on conceptual discussions as well as from insights emerging from empirical work.},

abstract = {The skills mismatch and spatial mismatch perspectives are often presented as competing explanations of the spatial distribution of unemployment within metropolitan areas. This paper argues that the spatial mismatch hypothesis addresses some of the shortcomings of the skills mismatch perspective, while not denying the importance of skills mismatch. The development of the spatial mismatch hypothesis in the US is traced, before considering its relevance in the British context. A framework in which to conceptualise and reconcile skills mismatch and spatial mismatch within metropolitan areas is developed, incorporating the operation of local housing and labour markets as well as the role of commuting. The paper concludes by arguing that skills and spatial mismatches reinforce each other and that the concept of employability offers some potential to help understand how job searchers and employers make decisions in situations of skills and/or spatial mismatch. The implications for future research are highlighted.},

The author proposes a framework for a theoretical general equilibrium model that may explain the existence of a spatial equilibrium with inequalities in employment and income in various regions. This model explains the interregional imbalances on the labor demand side due to the changes in relative land prices and agglomeration economies and diseconomies in three separate types of economic sectors. On the labor supply side, the model suggests a pattern of a commuting–migration relationship by which labor migrates for housing reasons while retaining present jobs and commuting back to them. Government interven- tion through influence on travel costs, education, and land allocation can lead to the diminution of such interregional gaps.},

To date, no study has ever disaggregated the household income of married couples into the separate labor income components to see if one partner's income has a different effect than the other. Using a derived likelihood function to control for censoring in the wife's income, this paper estimates the effect of separate incomes on housing tenure choice, accounting for possible endogeneity of the wife's income. To compare the results of this estimation method, the paper also estimates the standard IV models, 2SLS and IV probit. While the results show that there is no endogeneity of the wife's income, ignoring the censoring of the endogenous variable (when a large fraction of observations are censored) can possibly lead to biased coefficient estimates. Also, this paper confirms the importance of total household income, which has a larger effect than the total disaggregated components. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Standard theorizing about poverty falls into two camps. Social scientists regard the behav- iors of the economically disadvantaged either as calculated adaptations to prevailing circum- stances or as emanating from a unique “culture of poverty,” rife with deviant values. The first camp presumes that people are highly rational, that they hold coherent and justified beliefs and pursue their goals effectively, without mistakes, and with no need for help. The second camp attributes to the poor a variety of psychological and attitudinal short-fallings that render their views often misguided and their choices falli- ble, leaving them in need of paternalistic guidance. We propose a third view. The behavioral patterns of the poor, we argue, may be neither perfectly calculating nor especially deviant. Rather, the poor may exhibit the same basic weaknesses and biases as do people from other walks of life, except that in poverty, with its narrow margins for error, the same behaviors often manifest themselves in more pronounced ways and can lead to worse outcomes. In what follows, we illustrate the kinds of insights that might be gained from a behaviorally more real- istic analysis of the economic conditions of the poor, and we propose that alternative policies for alleviating poverty be considered},

Recent trends in employment and earnings suggest that at lower levels of education, female labor force participation is driven by necessity rather than economic opportunities. Unit level estimation results confirm that participation of poorly educated women is mainly determined by economic push factors and social status effects. Only at the highest education levels do we see evidence of pull factors drawing women into the labor force at attractive employment and pay conditions. This affects, by 2004, only a small minority of India's women. So despite India's economic boom, it appears that for all but the very well educated, labor market conditions for women have not improved.},

While many theories explain why this change took place, we investigate the process of transition itself. We argue that local information transmission generates changes in participation that are geographically heterogeneous, locally correlated, and smooth in the aggregate, just like those observed in our data. In our model, women learn about the effects of maternal employment on children by observing nearby employed women. When few women participate in the labor force, data are scarce and participation rises slowly. As information accumulates in some re- gions, the effects of maternal employment become less uncertain and more women in that region participate. Learning accelerates, labor force participation rises faster, and regional participation rates diverge. Eventually, information diffuses throughout the economy, beliefs converge to the truth, participation flattens out, and regions become more similar again. To investigate the empirical relevance of our theory, we use a new county-level data set to compare our calibrated model to the time series and geographic patterns of participation.},

Being employed is seen as a major instrument in making women less dependent on their families and freeing them from the suppressing influence of patriarchal ideologies. However, only 35{\%} of married women are gainfully employed and half of them work as (family) farm workers. Women engaged in the formal economy are more highly educated, have husbands with higher occupations, have fewer children, live in the West and urban areas, are less suppressed by their families and have less traditional gender role attitudes. Not speaking Turkish is a major obstacle to economic independency for ethnic women. Findings basically support the U-curve hypothesis which predicts that with increasing modernization female employment first decreases and then increases. However, the effects of modernization are overshadowed by the strong influence of patriarchal ideology that tends to confine Turkish women to the private domain. The major way out of the web of patriarchal restrictions seems to be via education. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We extend the collective labor supply model developed by Chiappori to allow for distribution factors. We show that our model imposes new restrictions on the labor supply functions and eases the identification of individual preferences and the intrahousehold decision process. The model is estimated using PSID data for the year 1988. Our results do not reject the restrictions imposed by the model.

Analysis of five large cross-sectional micro surveys shows that a combination of supply and demand effects have contributed to this stagnation. The main supply side factors are rising household incomes and husband's education as well as the falling selectivity of highly educated women. On the demand side, the sectors that draw in female workers have expanded least, so that changes in the sectoral structure of employment alone would have actually led to declining participation rates.},

However, these patterns are uneven: segmentation takes different forms in the three urban areas examined here. I consider these results in light of human capital and labor market segmentation theory. Each of these approaches--particularly the latter--helps us understand the way capitalist labor markets operate, but the patterns of gender and ethnocultural participation are too complex to be adequately explained by either theory.},

abstract = {We examine whether and how the inflow of female immigrants who specialize in household production affects the labour supply of Italian women. To identify the causal effect, we exploit the family reunification motives and network effects (i.e., the tendency of newly arriving female immigrants to settle in places where males of the same country already live) which is used as an instrument for the geographical distribution of female foreign workers. We find that when the number of immigrants who provide household services is higher, native Italian women spend more time at work (intensive margin) without affecting their labour force participation (extensive margin). This impact is concentrated on highly skilled women whose time has a higher opportunity cost. These results also hold after a battery of robustness checks. We present some further evidence that is also consistent with the idea that the impact works through substitution in household work rather than complementarities in the production sector. Finally, we show that immigration arises as a substitute to publicly provided welfare services, although this phenomenon raises concerns regarding the fairness and sustainability of this private and informal welfare model. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This chapter summarizes recent research in economics that investigates differentials by race and gender in the labor market. We start with a statistical overview of the trends in labor market outcomes by race, gender and Hispanic origin, including some simple regressions on the determinants of wages and employment. This is followed in Section 3 by an extended review of current theories about discrimination in the labor market, including recent extensions of taste-based theories, theories of occupational exclusion, and theories of statistical discrimination. Section 4 discusses empirical research that provides direct evidence of discrimination in the labor market, beyond "unexplained gaps" in wage or employment regressions. The remainder of the chapter reviews the evidence on race and gender gaps, particularly wage gaps. Section 5 reviews research on the impact of pre-market human capital differences in education and family background that differ by race and gender. Section 6 reviews the impact of differences in both the levels and the returns to experience and seniority, with discussion of the role of training and labor market search and turnover on race and gender differentials. Section 7 reviews the role of job characteristics (particularly occupational characteristics) in the gender wage gap. Section 8 reviews the smaller literature on differences in fringe benefits by gender. Section 9 is an extensive discussion of the empirical work that accounts for changes in the trends in race and gender differentials over time. Of particular interest is the new research literature that investigates the impact of widening wage inequality on race and gender wage gaps. Section 10 reviews research that relates policy changes to race and gender differentials, including anti-discrimination policy. The chapter concludes with comments about a future research agenda. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the migration of Latin American women from rural to urban areas and their occupational and domestic alternatives in the cities. Inquiry into the relationship between work (or economic par- ticipation) of women and family organization has been neglected in the Latin American social sciences, especially in studies focusing on the urban areas. Thus the ideas presented here are highly tentative, and my purpose is to suggest a framework for future research rather than an analytical scheme to cope with a mass of existing data. I will first discuss the main characteristics of rural-to-urban migration in the region, in order to place female migrants in the context of spatial relocation for the population as a whole. Then I will address questions about the produc- tive role of migrant women in the cities, especially their role in domestic service. For the individual migrant, domestic service may be an impor- tant means of adaptation to urban life and the urban labor market, although there is some stigma attached to this kind of work. Within the labor market, domestic service has some specific features as regards both supply and demand. Finally, domestic service has a special place in the urban economy, sharing traits of domestic production for self- consumption while carrying a monetary payment and thus sharing some traits of wage work. In dealing with this last subject, the focus will neces- sarily have to shift to the household unit (or the family) where both the unpaid and the paid domestic production take place.},

abstract = {This paper examines an affirmative action program for "lower-caste" groups in engineering colleges in India. We study both the targeting properties of the program, and its implications for labor market outcomes. We find that affirmative action successfully targets the financially disadvantaged: the upper-caste applicants that are displaced by affirmative action come from a richer economic background than the lower-caste applicants that are displacing them. Targeting by caste, however, may lead to the exclusion of other disadvantaged groups. For example, caste-based targeting reduces the overall number of females entering engineering colleges. We find that despite poor entrance exam scores, lower-caste entrants obtain a positive return to admission. Our estimates, however, also suggest that these gains may come at an absolute cost because the income losses experienced by displaced upper-caste applicants are larger than the income gains experienced by displacing lower-caste students. Limited sample sizes in our preferred econometric specifications, however, prevent us from drawing strong conclusions from these labor market findings. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Women make up a little over half the world's population, but their contribution to measured economic activity, growth, and well-being is far below its potential, with serious macroeconomic consequences. Despite significant progress in recent decades, labor markets across the world remain divided along gender lines, and progress toward gender equality seems to have stalled. Female labor force participation (FLFP) has remained lower than male participation, women account for most unpaid work, and when women are employed in paid work, they are overrepresented in the informal sector and among the poor. They also face significant wage differentials vis-{\`{a}}-vis their male colleagues. In many countries, distortions and discrimination in the labor market restrict women's options for paid work, and female representation in senior positions and entrepreneurship remains low. The challenges of growth, job creation, and inclusion are closely intertwined. While growth and stability are necessary to give women the opportunities they need, women's participation in the labor market is also a part of the growth and stability equation. In particular, in rapidly aging economies, higher female labor force participation can boost growth by mitigating the impact of a shrinking workforce. Better opportunities for women can also contribute to broader economic development in developing economies, for instance through higher levels of school enrollment for girls. This Staff Discussion Note examines the specific macro-critical features of women's participation in the labor market, the constraints preventing women from developing their full economic potential, and possible policies to overcome these obstacles. Implementing policies that remove labor market distortions and create a level playing field for all will give women the opportunity to develop their potential and to participate in economic life more visibly.},

abstract = {The authors examine the impact of mobility on the labor-force status of two-earner households in the United States, in a longitudinal context. There has recently been a resurgence of interest within industry and academia in the impact of family migration on the labor-force status of women, and on dual-earner families in general. Much of the research in this field has documented the disruptive effects of migration on the labor-force status of women, particularly with respect to unemployment, underemployment, and interrupted careers. However, there is another body of research that has challenged the disruption assumption with findings that many women benefit from family migration. The conflicting results persist when the modeling procedures account for the selectivity of migrants. Missing from the literature is a comparison of the impact of mobility on the labor-force status of men as well as women at varying geographical scales. The authors have used a new methodology to extend previous work on the impact of family migration by directly comparing the labor-force status of dual-earner households who migrate long distances, with that of households who move within the same labor market, and with that of households who remain residentially stable. The authors have used data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to show conclusively that, although there are disruptive effects, these are relatively short lived for most households. In addition, the results suggest that average changes mask very large variations in what happens to husbands and wives who relocate. This study emphasizes the dynamic nature of wives' labor-force participation relative to their husbands' immediately before and after a move, a finding that has not been established by other work on migration and labor-force participation.},

Although male and female MBAs have nearly identical earnings at the outset of their careers, their earnings soon diverge, with the male earnings advantage reaching almost 60 log points a decade after MBA completion. Three proximate factors account for the large and rising gender gap in earnings: differences in training prior to MBA graduation, differences in career interruptions, and differences in weekly hours. The greater career discontinuity and shorter work hours for female MBAs are largely associated with motherhood. (JEL J16, J22, J31, J44)},

abstract = {A consumption theory of migration is developed which supplements the traditional job search models. Migration, seen as an equilibrating reaction to an initially non-optimal location, is analyzed using standard demand theory. When one groups goods into those that are traded between areas and those that are not (weather, racial discrimination, crime rates, etc.) it is clear that only changing demands for the non-traded goods will result in changing optimal locations (assuming supplies are fixed). Illustrating, an increase in family income might lead to an increased demand for the non-traded good "personal safety." This might result, for example, in the substitution (through migration) of a lower crime suburban neighborhood for a higher crime central city neighborhood. An empirically testable implication of the model is that the probability of migration should be positively related to changes in the absolute value of those exogenous variables which lead to altered demands for non-traded goods. This and other hypotheses were examined using cross-sectional data in a nonlinear maximum likelihood (probit) regression analysis. The results strongly support the model and its implications. ?? 1979.},

abstract = {"The current work extends the modeling of the household migration decision to take into account location-specific influences and relates these to regional wage differentials. This allows for more complete analysis of real wage gains or losses associated with migration and inferences regarding the nature of equilibrium or disequilibrium wage differentials between regions." Data are from the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics for the period 1976-1978. "The results indicate systematic and often substantial influences of household location on the nominal wage and on both job and residence mobility. Based on these findings, comparisons of wage growth patterns are made for those changing jobs and region of residence status. Although compared to other households the wage growth of these migrants is on average lower before migration and higher after migration, the analysis provides no support for arguments that nominal regional wage differentials reflect systematic ordering of real wage differentials. This finding suggests that real wage gains are closely tied to the interregional migration decision but are not related to regional nominal wage differentials in a simple fashion."},

@article{Hohenberg2004,
abstract = {Over a millennium Europe has become largely urban. While urban growth, absolute and as a percentage of a growing population, has been as dramatic as economic change, many elements of continuity tie the present to the past. This evolution with path de- pendence is highlighted if one looks at European urban economies in terms of a dual systems model combining central place and network relationships. After the medieval push of town creation and differentiation, the early modem period saw a slowing of the increase in urban population and proportion, even as cities anchored the growth of overseas trade and of integrated territorial states. Growth was concentrated in major ports and capital or court cities. The role of cities in the rise of a market economy ca- pable of sustained growth in output per head is tied to ongoing debates about how and why growth began in Europe, and within Europe in England. Industrialization led to enormous increases in urban agglomeration driven by transport improvements and in- creasing returns to scale in manufacturing as well as distribution. However, leadership functions tended to concentrate in giant capital cities rather than in the new industrial towns and conurbations. Within cities, rapid in-migration and lags in institutions and technology for urban management aggravated crowding and squalor. Conditions im- proved toward the turn of the 20th century, thanks in part to electricity and to more re- sponsive and active government, as well as to slower urbanization. The depression and destruction of the 1914-1945 period was followed by great prosperity and enormous building. The information age appears to have conflicting impacts on agglomeration in Europe, with policy leaning toward sustaining dense cities (relative at least to the U.S.). The shift from older to newer industries, as well as growth in leisure and high human capital pursuits, has shifted activity away from many 19th century industrial centers and toward revitalized older cities and urbanized regions with higher amenity levels.},

Utilizing longitudinal data from the 1992 and 1994 waves of the Thailand National Migration Survey, logistic regression models show that a strikingly different set of expectations, household demographic indicators, and migrant capital factors were significant determinants of migration intentions for men and women; reflecting Thai gender roles. Migration intentions, in turn, predicted more permanent, but not temporary, survival strategy migration behaviour, while low household income predicted temporary but not more permanent migration behaviour. The measure of perceived family migration norms was a powerful determinant of migration behaviour, but the size of migrant networks was not a statistically significant determinant},

abstract = {The large research literature in urban labour market analysis is reviewed, with the emphasis ranging from attempts to model aggregate simultaneous interactions between residential and workplace location to more modern econometric work researching individual labour market behaviour. The job search process is central to the operation of the labour market, yet research is hampered by variable data availability and the limited observability of the search mechanism. Individual responses to major employer relocations have been recently studied, especially the substitutability of the move or quit decision, and relationships to race and gender. The variation of commuting patterns by income and professional status has also been analysed, and the functioning of the dispersed service-dominated modern urban labour market raises challenging research issues including willingness to search and commute over substantial areas, interacting with family circumstances and expected job security. The continued growth in all developed economies of female labour force participation and numbers of female-headed households have raised the importance of urban labour market research focusing on gender, including the economic understanding of patterns in the length of the female journey to work. Study of the influence of racial segregation on outcomes in the urban labour market has a longer history, with the “spatial mismatch hypothesis” having developed a large literature since the 1960s. With higher quality microdata and modern computational power and econometric techniques, statistical research has advanced considerably. Similar spatial relationships between race and labour market and commuting outcomes are also intrinsic to the European urban labour market, and have received particular attention from British, Dutch, Austrian and French researchers. The chapter concludes with an overview of contrasts between inter- and intraurban labour market adjustment processes.},

abstract = {The past half-century has witnessed a dramatic change in the way in which people live. Fifty years ago, only a small proportion of the less developed world lived in cities, and world poverty was overwhelmingly rural. In 1950, less than one-fifth of the population of the “third world” was urban; in the next five years or so, a majority of developing countries' populations will be urban. This dramatic social change has captured the attention of development economists and, to a lesser degree, urban economists. This chapter examines what has been learned in a variety of areas. Section 1 discusses the stylized patterns of urbanization in the developing world, while Section 2 turns to models of third world city growth and their empirical estimates, discussing partial equilibrium models, general equilibrium models, economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, demographic-economic perspectives, and household migration modeling. Section 3 considers the impact of government policies on urbanization. Particular attention is devoted to structural adjustment policies, urban biases in public expenditures, and issues unique to (ex)-socialist economies. Section 4 examines structural impediments to urban development, including labor and land markets, transportation issues, public finance and social infrastructure concerns, and urban spatial structure. The final section looks at the macroeconomic impacts of urbanization—on wage gaps and income distribution, demand patterns and economic efficiency.11This survey should be regarded as a complement to Lucas' (1997) survey of internal migration in developing countries for the Handbook of Population and Family Economics.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration economies and urban public infrastructure. Theory links the two concepts by positing that agglomeration economies exist when firms in an urban area share a public good as an input to production. One type of shareable input is the close proximity of businesses and labor, that generates positive externalities which in turn lower the production cost of one business as the output of other businesses increases. The externalities result from businesses sharing nonexcludable inputs, such as a common labor pool, technical expertise, general knowledge and personal contacts. Another perhaps more tangible type of shareable input is urban public infrastructure. Public capital stock, such as highways, water treatment facilities, and communication systems, directly affect the efficient operation of cities by facilitating business activities and improving worker productivity. The literature has devoted considerable attention to both topics, but not together. Studies of agglomeration economies in several countries find that manufacturing firms are more productive in large cities than in smaller ones. Studies of the effect of infrastructure on productivity show positive, but in some cases statistically insignificant, effects of public capital stock on productivity. Most of these studies are at the national and state levels. Only a handful of studies have focused on the metropolitan level, and even fewer have estimated agglomeration economies and infrastructure effects simultaneously. Results from studies that include both types of shared inputs suggest that both spatial proximity and physical infrastructure contribute positively to the productivity of firms in urban areas. More research is needed to explore the interrelationships between urban size and urban public infrastructure and to open the “black box” of agglomeration economies and estimate how the various other factors associated with urban size affect productivity.},

One of the surprising features of the Krugman [Journal of Political Economy 99 (1991) 483–499] model, was that the introduction of partial labor mobility in a standard “new trade model” with trade costs could lead to catastrophic agglomeration. The growth analog to this result is that the introduction of endogenous growth in the same type of “new trade model” can lead to the same result. A difference with the labour mobility version is that the results are easier to derive from the analytical point of view in the endogenous growth version. We show that the relation between growth and agglomeration depends crucially on capital (human or physical) mobility between regions. The absence of capital mobility is at the heart of the possibility of spatial agglomeration with catastrophe. In addition, growth alters the process of location even without catastrophe. In particular, and contrary to the fundamentally static models of the New Economic Geography, spatial concentration of economic activities may be consistent with a process of delocation of firms towards poor regions. Finally, the presence of localized technology spillovers implies that spatial agglomeration is conducive to growth.},

Several different modeling strategies have been used to examine housing markets and migration and the review of these approaches includes linear programming models, gravity and entropy models, log-linear models, discrete choice and random utility models, behavioral and search models, elimination-by-aspects models and microsimulation models. In this way, this chapter gives an overview of the state of the art in residential mobility and household locational modeling.

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews a concise survey and a set of reflections concerning current regional and multiregional economic models. The notation “current” refers to the situation around the mid-1980s. A number of reviews of multiregional economic models undertaken in the first half of the 1980s forms the primary input for this survey. The chapter provides the use of such models. Three kinds of uses are envisaged: forecasting and scenario generation, policy impact analysis, and policy generation or design. Thus, the type of regional and multiregional economic models that are given attention in the chapter are used for decision-making support. Regional economic models—to be useful—need to pass both relevance and validity tests. The relevance test addresses the issue of modeling for specific situations or adhering to theoretical stringency. Policy-makers are often keen on detailed, but partial and simple models. Adaption mechanisms in a model are often not appreciated. The validity issue is related to the role of regional data for economic model building. Data problems make estimation and validation, especially of dynamic models, a problem in a regional context. This is a serious threat to the success of regional economic models for policy purposes, particularly in the current , generally less stable, economic environments. },

The chapter focuses on the study of PFL-problems that are related to different aspects of these traditions. The perspective in this study is not intra-urban but regional. This is emphasized by a concentration on location problems in the agendas of the following type: (i) location among municipalities in a region and (ii) location among regions in a national (or multiregional) perspective. Taking a region as a reference area, the chapter identifies the coordination problem of a regional authority and the simultaneous game-like competition among each municipality of the region. Municipality refers to a community with a local government. A similar two-level decision problem is also identified for settings with a national authority and independent regional authorities. The chapter presents various types of PFL-problems and deals with the aggregation of demand and supply from the subregional to the regional level.},

abstract = {This paper provides the first systematic empirical assessment of the pace at which housing investment has responded to rising demand from urbanization. The assessment used National Accounts Statistics to build a data set of residential housing investment for more than 90 countries. The data set explicitly accounts for investment by households, the government, and the private sector. The analysis finds that housing investment follows an S-shaped trajectory taking off around per capita GDP of about {\$}3,000 (US{\$}2005) and tapering down at per capita GDP around {\$}36,000 (US{\$}2005). The analysis also finds that between 2001 and 2011, housing investment in low-income economies averaged 4.56 percent of gross domestic product and 9.12 percent in upper-middle-income economies. An impor- tant finding is that countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have housing elasticities similar to comparable low-income and lower-middle-income economies. In financing housing investment, the paper finds that developing countries tend to rely much more on domestic savings and government debt, whereas high-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries lever capital markets by tapping foreign savings. Not only does exces- sive reliance on domestic savings and government debt increase the sensitivity of housing investment to the cycli- cality of growth of gross domestic product, it also can potentially crowd out investments in health and education.},

abstract = {Abstract To enhance government accountability, reformers have advocated strengthening institutions of “horizontal accountability,” particularly auditing institutions that can punish lawbreaking elected officials. Yet, these institutions differ in their willingness to punish corrupt politicians, which is often attributed to variation in their degree of independence from the political branches. Taking advantage of a randomized natural experiment embedded in Brazil's State Audit Courts, we study how variation in the appointment mechanisms for choosing auditors affects political accountability. We show that auditors appointed under few constraints by elected officials punish lawbreaking politicians—particularly co-partisans—at lower rates than bureaucrats insulated from political influence. In addition, we find that even when executives are heavily constrained in their appointment of auditors by meritocratic and professional requirements, auditors still exhibit a pro-politician bias in decision making. Our results suggest that removing bias requires a level of insulation from politics rare among institutions of horizontal accountability. 1Massachusetts},

Abstract In this paper, we examine the effects of land use zoning and density regulations on formal housing supply and slum formation across Brazilian cities between 1980 and 2000. In particular we look at the performance of cities that have lowered land subdivision (minimum lot size) regulation from the federally mandated 125 m 2 . We develop a model of formal housing supply and slum formation where population growth is endogenous and household migration decisions are influenced by inter city variations in land regulations. We find that the elasticity of formal housing supply in Brazil is very low, and comparable to those found in Malaysia and South Korea, which have highly regulated housing markets. Our analysis of land regulations shows that (a) general purpose zoning and land use planning improves performance of the housing market and stimulates formal sector housing response; (b) lowering minimum lot size regulations increases housing supply but is also accompanied by higher population growth. We find that population growth is faster than the formal housing supply response, leading to an increase in slum formation. This suggests that policies that aim to reduce barriers for access to land need to be accompanied by instruments that relax pre-existing distortions in the land market. In the absence of these measures, pro poor land regulations may in fact exacerbate the slum formation problem.},

Using information from 27 Brazilian state governments, the paper shows that the level of political competition and the degree of political autonomy of the fiscal watchdogs explain the extent of creative accounting in the Brazilian federation. Despite hard budget constraints imposed by the much-acclaimed Fiscal Responsibility Law, state governors retain the strategic ability to undertake fiscal window dressing in response to fiscal stress. As fiscal watchdogs are not immune to the influence of the legislature and state governor, however, this paper demonstrates that their level of independence and autonomy is associated with the degree of creative accounting. In addition, we show that political competition encourages non-compliance through various causal mechanisms. Building effective and autonomous institutions is a precondition for deterring fiscal misconduct but this solution is ultimately a by-product of a political equilibrium resulting from self- enforced behavior of politicians.},

While local labor demand changes fundamentally caused the increased skill sorting, it was further fueled by endogenous increases in amenities within higher skill cities.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

The program makes cash transfers to mothers and pregnant women in poor households. Bureaucratic mistakes, beyond the control of the applicants, have inadvertently excluded many households that had applied and were accepted to the program. This unintentional natural experiment is used to identify the impact of an exogenous variation in female nonlabor income over household consumption. We find that program participation led to an increase in food expenditure, but this effect is not due to women being the benefit recipients. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Abstract The temporary participation in the labor force of wives whose husbands have become unemployed has been referred to in the literature as the “added worker effect” (AWE). Previous research conducted using data from the United States has found only a small AWE, a result that accords with life cycle models with perfect capital markets. The current article uses panel data obtained using a short recall period to evaluate the AWE in the six major Brazilian metropolitan areas. Our results show a positive AWE that is much more substantial than those found for the U.S. economy. The finding of an important AWE for Brazil suggests that liquidity constraints may prevent Brazilian households from sufficiently smoothing income and consumption in periods when the male head of the family is unemployed. Alternatively, the significant AWE may indicate that the husband's unemployment signals household members that there may be a substantial reduction in future income flow.

Rapid skill upgrading within detailed industries accounts for most of the growth in the relative demand for college workers, particularly since 1970. Analyses of four data sets indicate that the rate of skill upgrading has been greater in more computer-intensive industries.},

abstract = {High- and low-wage occupations are expanding rapidly relative to middle-wage occupations in both the U.S. and the E.U. We study the reallocation of workers from middle-skill occupations towards the tails of the occupational skill distribution by analyzing changes in age structure within and across occupations. Because occupations typically expand by hiring young workers and contract by curtailing such hiring, we posit that growing occupations will get younger while shrinking occupations will ‘get old.' After verifying this proposition, we apply this observation to local labor markets in the U.S. to test whether markets that were specialized in middle-skilled occupations in 1980 saw a differential movement of both older and younger workers into occupations at the tails of the skill distribution over the subsequent 25 years. Consistent with aggregate trends, employment in initially middle-skill-intensive labor markets hollowed-out between 1980 and 2005. Employment losses among non-college workers in the middle of the occupational skill distribution were almost entirely countered by employment growth in lower-tail occupations. For college workers, employment losses at the middle were offset in roughly equal measures by gains in the upper- and lower-tails of the occupational skill distribution. But gains at the upper-tail were almost entirely limited to young college workers. Consequently, older college workers are increasingly found in lower-skill, lower-paying occupations.},

Regional exposure to technological change, as measured by specialization in routine task-intensive production and clerical occupations, is largely uncorrelated with regional exposure to trade competition from China. While the impacts of technology are dispersed throughout the United States, the impacts of trade tend to be more geographically concentrated, owing in part to the spatial agglomeration of labor-intensive manufacturing. Our findings highlight the feasibility of separately identifying the impacts of recent changes in trade and technology on US regional economies.},

Individuals who in 1991 worked in manufacturing industries that experienced high subsequent import growth garner lower cumulative earnings, face elevated risk of obtaining public disability benefits, and spend less time working for their initial employers, less time in their initial two-digit manufacturing industries, and more time working elsewhere in manufacturing and outside of manufacturing. Earnings losses are larger for individuals with low initial wages, low initial tenure, and low attachment to the labor force. Low-wage workers churn primarily among manufacturing sectors, where they are repeatedly exposed to subsequent trade shocks. High-wage workers are better able to move across employers with minimal earnings losses and are more likely to move out of manufacturing conditional on separation. These findings reveal that import shocks impose substantial labor adjustment costs that are highly unevenly distributed across workers according to their skill levels and conditions of employment in the pre-shock period.},

abstract = {Even before the Great Recession, U.S. employment growth was unimpressive. Between 2000 and 2007, the economy gave back the considerable gains in employment rates it had achieved during the 1990s, with major contractions in manufacturing employment being a prime contributor to the slump. The U.S. employment “sag” of the 2000s is widely recognized but poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the contribution of the swift rise of import competition from China to sluggish U.S. employment growth. We find that the increase in U.S. imports from China, which accelerated after 2000, was a major force behind recent reductions in U.S. manufacturing employment and that, through input-output linkages and other general equilibrium effects, it appears to have significantly suppressed overall U.S. job growth. We apply industry-level and local labor market-level approaches to estimate the size of (a) employment losses in directly exposed manufacturing industries, (b) employment effects in indirectly exposed upstream and downstream industries inside and outside manufacturing, and (c) the net effects of conventional labor reallocation, which should raise employment in non-exposed sectors, and Keynesian multipliers, which should reduce employment in non-exposed sectors. Our central estimates suggest net job losses of 2.0 to 2.4 million stemming from the rise in import competition from China over the period 1999 to 2011. The estimated employment effects are larger in magnitude at the local labor market level, consistent with local general equilibrium effects that amplify the impact of import competition},

Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations (employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor.

The essay argues that allowing for a richer set of interactions between skills and technologies in accomplishing job tasks both augments and refines the predictions of Goldin and Katzs approach and suggests an even more important role for human capital in economic growth than indicated by their analysis.},

Contrary to the literature on the United States, which has increasingly focused on the role of amenities, existing research in Europe tends to highlight the predominance of economic conditions as the main drivers of migration. Differentiating between economic, sociodemographic and amenity-related territorial features, we examine the appeal of various regional characteristics for migrants by analyzing net migration data for 133 European regions between 1990 and 2006. Our results show that, in addition to economic, human capital-related and demographic aspects, network effects and—in contrast to existing literature—different types of regional amenities exert an important influence on the relative attractiveness of sub-national territories across the European Union. Our findings therefore indicate that locational choices in Europe may be much more similar to place-based preferences in the United States than originally thought.},

abstract = {Human capital is unequally distributed across cities or regions within a country. The way how the spatial distribution of human capital evolves over time sheds light on the strength of concentration forces for high-skilled workers, such as localised increasing returns to human capital. In this paper I analyse the impact of human capital on local employment growth for Western German regions (1977-2006). Two main empirical facts are established: "Skilled cities" in Western Germany grow faster. At the same time there is convergence of human capital shares across cities, i.e., high-skilled workers do not increasingly concentrate in space. Whereas the first fact (the "smart city hypothesis") similarly holds in Germany and in the US, there is a striking difference when it comes to the second fact. Some researchers have found an opposite trend of human capital divergence across US metropolitan areas. My findings suggest that human capital exhibits a different spatial trend in different countries. I present a theoretical model which shows that the spatial convergence trend does not imply that concentration forces for high-skilled workers are absent in Western Germany, but only that they are relatively weak compared to countervailing dispersion forces. I further discuss some reasons that may explain the differences between Western Germany and the US. I emphasise the role of the tax system and the impact of pro-dispersive regional policy in Europe.},

Our results show a more heterogenous set of drivers for individual well-being across regions in Europe than previously described. Not only are individual-level effects significant, but so too are regional factors. In particular, absolute regional factors dominate the effect of an individual's position relative to their region for certain non-economic variables.

This study uses the hedonic technique to measure the amenity value of the climate to German households. Evidence suggests that the amenity value of climate variables is capitalized mainly into hedonic house price differentials. Overall, German households appear to prefer warmer winters with less rainfall. Combining estimates of amenity values with the predicted changes in climate associated with the IPCC's A2 emissions scenario we find that the overall impact of climate change on German households, whilst negative, is typically not statistically different from zero. This occurs in part because the prediction is for warmer but wetter winters and also because the amenity value of some climate variables cannot be measured with sufficient precision.},

European subnational units (regions) are defined according to the first-level {\{}EU{\}} nomenclature$\backslash$nof territorial units. We use multilevel modeling to explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of our data, respondents$\backslash$nwithin regions and countries, and for understanding patterns of variation within and between regions. Main findings are that$\backslash$npersonal income matters more in poor regions than in rich regions, a pattern that still holds for regions within the same$\backslash$ncountry. Being unemployed is negatively associated with life satisfaction even after controlled for income variation. Living$\backslash$nin high unemployment regions does not alleviate the unhappiness of being out of work. After controlling for individual characteristics$\backslash$nand modeling interactions, regional differences in life satisfaction still remain, confirming that regional dimension is relevant$\backslash$nfor life satisfaction.},

abstract = {This paper examines if the effects of agglomeration economies are manifested in technical efficiency and generate faster economic growth and higher (lower) levels of employment (unemployment). Using the prefecture level data for each of the two-digit groups of industries in Japan, it estimates a region-specific technical efficiency index based on the stochastic frontier production function framework. The factor analysis shows that in most of the industry-groups, efficiency has a positive association with external scale variable(s). Though the relationship is not very strong, it would be erroneous to ignore the effect of agglomeration economies on efficiency. For some light goods industries, the agglomeration effect is relatively stronger. Economic growth varies positively with external scale variable(s) and the unemployment rate tends to fall with respect to growth and concentration. This suggests that measures against industrial concentration may be counter-productive, particularly in the context of globalization when countries greatly need to raise productivity.

First, we use dynamic panel estimation techniques (system GMM), thus offering an alternative methodological treatment of the inherent endogeneity problem. Second, the sector dimension in the data allows for disaggregated estimation. Our results confirm the presence of significant agglomeration effects at the aggregate level, with an estimated long-run elasticity of 13{\%}. Repeated cross-section regressions suggest that the strength of agglomeration effects has increased over time.

In the main part of the paper spatial econometric models are estimated and our results provide preliminary evidence of the role played by geographical and economic factors on employment growth and industrial spatial reallocation. The analysis suggests that diversified economies within metropolitan areas and close to the state's capital are subject to relatively more intense dynamics. However, controlling for a range of variables, smaller towns have been growing and churning more rapidly than the large cities. We have also evidenced that the presence of universities and the participation of the private sector are important for this dynamism.We also find that employment growth is subject to local spatial externalities but industrial churning is not.},

To analyse this phenomenon, we build on the theory by Gabaix (1999 Quarterly Journal of Economics, 94:739-767) that Zipf's law follows (under certain conditions) from a stochastic urban growth process. In particular, Gabaix shows that if urban growth in all regions follows Gibrat's law, we should observe the Zipfian rank-size rule among large cities both at the regional and national level. This theory has never been addressed empirically. Using non-parametric techniques and various definitions of a 'region', we find that Gibrat's law holds at the regional level. Consistently, we find that city size distributions at the national and regional levels tend to follow a Zipfian power law. {\textcopyright} The Author (2010). Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract = {This paper uses empirical evidence on the evolution and structure of the West-German city size distribution to assess the relevance of three different theories of urban growth. The West-German case is of particular interest as Germany's urban system has been subject to some of history's largest (exogenous) shocks during the 20th century. A unique annual data set for 62 West-German cities that covers the period 1925-1999 allows for the identification of these shocks and provides evidence on the effects of these 'quasi-natural experiments' on the city size distribution as a whole as well as on each city separately. Our main findings are twofold. First, WWII has had a major and lasting impact on the city size distribution. Second, and heavily based upon the results of (panel) unit root tests that analyze the evolution of the individual cities that make up the West-German city size distribution, city growth is found to be trend stationary, which is not in line with Gibrat's Law of proportional effect. Overall, our findings are most consistent with theories emphasizing the role of increasing returns to scale for city growth. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Redistributive policies carried out by the central government through interregional government transfers is a relevant feature of the Brazilian federal fiscal system. Regional shares of the central government revenues in the poorer regions have been recurrently smaller than the shares of central government expenditures in those regions. Appeal to core-periphery outcomes could be made, as S{\~{a}}o Paulo, the wealthiest state in the country, concentrated, in 2005, over 40{\%} of total Federal tax revenue, receiving less than 35{\%} of Federal expenditures. These figures suggest a redistribution of public funds from the spatial economic core of the economy to the peripheral areas. This paper investigates the role interregional transfers play in the redistribution of activities in the country, using an interregional input-output approach. Counterfactual simulations allow us to estimate some costs and benefits, for the core and periphery respectively, from such fiscal mechanisms},

abstract = {This paper tests whether demand shocks affect firm dynamics. We examine whether firms that win government procurement contracts grow more compared to firms that compete for these contracts but do not win. We assemble a comprehensive data set combining matched employer-employee data for the universe of formal firms in Brazil with the universe of federal government procurement contracts over the period of 2004 to 2010. Exploiting a quasi-experimental design, we find that winning at least one contract in a given quarter increases firm growth by 2.2 percentage points over that quarter, with 93{\%} of the new hires coming from either unemployment or the informal sector. These effects also persist well beyond the length of the contracts. Part of this persistence comes from firms participating and wining more future auctions, as well as penetrating other markets.},

abstract = {There was substantial spatial variation in labor market outcomes in Brazil over the 1990's. In 2000, about one-fifth of workers lived in apparently economically stagnant municipios where real wages declined but employment increased faster than the national population growth rate. More than one-third lived in apparently dynamic municipios experiencing both real wage growth and faster-than-average employment growth; these areas absorbed more than half of net employment growth over the period. To elucidate this spatial variation, we estimated spatial labor supply and demand equations describing wage and employment changes of Brazilian munic{\'{i}}pios. We used Conley's spatial GMM technique to allow for instrumental variable estimation in the presence of spatially autocorrelated errors. Chief findings include: a very strong influence of initial workforce educational levels on subsequent wage growth (controlling for possibly confounding variables such as remoteness and climate); evidence of positive spillover effects of ownmunicipio growth onto neighbors' wage and employment levels; an exodus from farming areas; relatively elastic response of wages to an increase in labor supply; and evidence of a local multiplier effect from government transfers.},

abstract = {The article discusses some of the new issues raised by the recent surge of foreign direct investments in Brazil, especially in the auto industry. Known as the fiscal war, or bidding war, competition over these investments derives from a decrease in private investments (based on decisions made at multinational corporate headquarters) and from an increase in public spending. Stimulated by the central government, this competition exacerbates the federative conflict and hampers the generation of regional development projects aimed at decreasing inequalities. The most visible signs of this dispute are the wasting of public resources, predatory fragmentation, and uncertainty about return on investments. Based on the emergence of institutional innovations, reactions to these policies have nevertheless proven important to the future of municipalities and states.},

abstract = {While most economic studies of crime have focused on its determinants, we study the reverse question: does crime affect economic behavior? Being such an important social phenomenon, one would expect crime to affect economic decisions. Using local data on crime rates and savings per capita in a high-crime environment, we document a striking empirical relationship: crime induces savings. Our paper is one of the first to successfully relate crime to an economic outcome. This result is robust to an extensive sensitivity analysis, which include: 1) controlling to a large set of demographic covariates; 2) accounting for the fact that crime and savings may be determined jointly; 3) measuring savings in different ways; 4) accounting for the presence of possible outliers; 5) weighting the data according to population; 6) accounting for spatial correlation; and, finally, 7) estimating the model for different sub-samples of cities. Our estimates indicate that only property, not violent, crime induces savings, which is consistent with the theoretical explanations on why crime would increase thriftiness},

abstract = {This paper investigates how political incentives affect the allocation of public investments using data from Brazil's Chamber of Deputies. Federal deputies can submit budgetary amendments for public works in their state's municipalities. Our results show that federal deputies reward municipalities based on political support. A 10 percentage point increase in vote shares received in the previous election implies an expected increase of R{\$}75,174 in public works for a municipality during the electoral cycle. Political motivations also influence the type of public work the municipality receives, even conditioning on its local needs. Because these public goods vary in their degree of exclusion, politicians prefer to allocate goods that less excludable to municipal- ities where they received more political support. With the allocation of public investments manipulated to meet political objectives, we ex- amine the impact of these public works on local welfare. We show that public investment while increasing average per capita income, also in- creased local income inequality.},

These conditions are developed using the Todaro model of rural-urban migration for LDCs. Data for 14 LDCs are then examined to see what the elasticities of migration with respect to job probability would have to be in order for the paradox of job creation increasing unemployment to hold. These elasticities are small enough that the paradox can be expected to hold for most LDCs.},

Due to the enforcement of household registration (hokou), illegal migrants from the rural area may search for and take a job in the city, though they suffer a wage mark-down as well as a faster break-up. We characterize the equilibrium wage discount, the job finding rate, and the unemployment rate in the urban labor market. We find that the enforcement of the household registration rule can discourage illegal migration, leading to a higher job finding rate and a lower urban unemployment rate.},

@article{Fields2016,
abstract = {This paper builds upon earlier work of mine which explored the determinants of population migration in Colombia. As before, the basic proposition is that areas' economic opportunities play a central role in determining the spatial allocation of the population. My earlier paper used published data from the 1973 Colombian Census of Population to establish that the rates of net lifetime migration into Colombia's 23 provinces (or, as they are known in Colombia, "departments") are associated with those areas' labor market conditions. The present paper uses unpublished data for 12 zones (six regions, rural and urban segments of each) to analyze the causes of place-to-place migration flows (lifetime and recent) for the population as a whole and for eight specific demographic groups (four educational categories and the two sexes). Several hypotheses are formulated and tested. The results give strong support to the economic model of migration, overall and in explaining differences in migration behavior among demographic groups. For Colombia this is particularly useful since some past work has been interpreted to the contrary.

abstract = {This paper reports estimates of the effects of JTPA training programs on the distribution of earnings. The estimation uses a new instrumental variable (IV) method that measures program impacts on quantiles. The quantile treatment effects (QTE) estimator reduces to quantile regression when selection for treatment is exogenously determined. QTE can be computed as the solution to a convex linear programming problem, although this requires first-step estimation of a nuisance function. We develop distribution theory for the case where the first step is estimated nonparametrically. For women, the empirical results show that the JTPA program had the largest proportional impact at low quantiles. Perhaps surprisingly, however, JTPA training raised the quantiles of earnings for men only in the upper half of the trainee earnings distribution.},

The chapter covers empirical work on rural-urban migration, theoretical research on migration and city-size determination, theoretical and empirical work on tenure security and squatting, and the issue of housing affordability.},

@article{Neumark2015,
abstract = {Place-based policies commonly target underperforming areas, such as deteriorating downtown business districts and disadvantaged regions. Principal examples include enterprise zones, European Union Structural Funds, and industrial cluster policies. Place-based policies are rationalized by various hypotheses in urban and labor economics, such as agglomeration economies and spatial mismatch-hypotheses that entail market failures and often predict overlap between poor economic performance and disadvantaged residents. The evidence on enterprise zones is very mixed. We need to know more about what features of enterprise zone policies make them more effective or less effective, who gains and who loses from these policies, and how we can reconcile the existing findings. Some evidence points to positive benefits of infrastructure expenditure and also investment in higher education and university research-likely because of the public-goods nature of these policies. However, to better guide policy, we need to know more about what policies create self-sustaining longer run gains.},

abstract = {Wages for more- and less-educated workers have followed strikingly different paths in the U.S. and Canada. During the 1980's and 1990's, the ratio of earnings of university graduates to high school graduates increased sharply in the U.S. but fell slightly in Canada. Katz and Murphy (1992) found that for the U.S. a simple supply-demand model fit the pattern of variation in the premium over time. We find that the same model and parameter estimates explain the variation between the U.S. and Canada. In both instances, the relative demand for more-educated labor shifts out at the same, consistent rate. Both over time and between countries, the variation in rate of growth of relative wages can be explained by variation in the relative supply of more-educated workers. Many economists suspect that technological change is causing the steady increases in the relative demand for more-educated labor. If so, these data provide independent evidence on the spatial and temporal variation in the pattern of technological change. Whatever is causing this increased demand for skill, the evidence from Canada suggest that increases in educational attainment and skills can reduce the rate at which relative wages diverge.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes a marked change in the evolution of the U.S. wage structure over the past fifteen years: divergent trends in upper-tail (90/50) and lower-tail (50/10) wage inequality. We document that wage inequality in the top half of distribution has displayed an unchecked and rather smooth secular rise for the last 25 years (since 1980). Wage inequality in the bottom half of the distribution also grew rapidly from 1979 to 1987, but it has ceased growing (and for some measures actually narrowed) since the late 1980s. Furthermore we find that occupational employment growth shifted from monotonically increasing in wages (education) in the 1980s to a pattern of more rapid growth in jobs at the top and bottom relative to the middles of the wage (education) distribution in the 1990s. We characterize these patterns as the {\%}u201Cpolarization{\%}u201D of the U.S. labor market, with employment polarizing into high-wage and low-wage jobs at the expense of middle-wage work. We show how a model of computerization in which computers most strongly complement the non-routine (abstract) cognitive tasks of high-wage jobs, directly substitute for the routine tasks found in many traditional middle-wage jobs, and may have little direct impact on non-routine manual tasks in relatively low-wage jobs can help explain the observed polarization of the U.S. labor market.},

abstract = {During the early 1980s, earnings inequality in the U.S. labor market rose relatively uniformly throughout the wage distribution. But this uniformity gave way to a significant divergence starting in 1987, with upper-tail (90/50) inequality rising steadily and lower tail (50/10) inequality either flattening or compressing for the next 16 years (1987 to 2003). This paper applies and extends a quantile decomposition technique proposed by Machado and Mata (2005) to evaluate the role of changing labor force composition (in terms of education and experience) and changing labor market prices to the expansion and subsequent divergence of upper- and lower-tail inequality over the last three decades We show that the extended Machado-Mata quantile decomposition corrects shortcomings of the original Juhn-Murphy-Pierce (1993) full distribution accounting method and nests the kernel reweighting approach proposed by DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996). Our analysis reveals that shifts in labor force composition have positively impacted earnings inequality during the 1990s. But these compositional shifts have primarily operated on the lower half of the earnings distribution by muting a contemporaneous, countervailing lower-tail price compression. The steady rise of upper tail inequality since the late 1970s appears almost entirely explained by ongoing between-group price changes (particularly increasing wage differentials by education) and residual price changes.},

Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We ?nd that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is asso- ciated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative de- mand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nomi- nally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact. INTRODUCTION},

@article{Autor2010a,
abstract = {Between December 2007, when the U.S. housing and financial crises became the subject of daily news headlines, and March of 2010, the latest period for which data are available, the number of employed workers in the United States fell by 8.2 million, to 129.8 million from 138.0 million. In the same interval, the civilian unemployment rate nearly doubled, to 9.7 percent from 5.0 percent, while the employment-to-population ratio dropped to 58.6 percent from 62.7 percentthe lowest level seen in more than 25 years. Job losses of this magnitude cause enormous harm to workers, families, and communities. 1 A classic study by economists Lou Jacobson, Robert LaLonde, and Daniel Sullivan found that workers involuntary displaced by plant downsizings in Pennsylvania during the severe recession of the early 1980s suffered annual earnings losses averaging 25 percent, even six years following displacement. 2 The nonpecuniary consequences of job losses due to the Great Recession may be just as severe. Studying the same group of workers with the benefit of 15 more years of data, labor economists Daniel Sullivan and co-author Till Von Wachter 3 show that involuntarily job displacement approximately doubled the short-term mortality rates of those displaced and reduced their life expectancy on average by one to one and a half years. Thus, long after the U.S. unemployment rate recedes into single digits, the costs of the Great Recession will endure. Despite the extremely adverse U.S. employment situation in 2010, history suggests that employment will eventually return and unemployment will eventually subside. But the key challenges facing the U.S. labor marketalmost all of which were evident prior to the Great Recessionwill surely endure. These challenges are two-fold. The first is that for some decades now, the U.S. labor market has experienced increased demand for skilled workers. During times like the 1950s and 1960s, a rising level of educational attainment kept up with this rising demand for skill. But since the late 1970s and early 1980s, the rise in U.S. education levels has not kept up with the rising demand for skilled workers, and the slowdown in educational attainment has been particularly severe for males. The result has been a sharp rise in the inequality of wages. A second, equally significant challenge is that the structure of job opportunities in the United States has sharply polarized over the past two decades, with expanding job opportunities in both high-skill, high-wage occupations and low-skill, lowwage occupations, coupled with contracting opportunities in middle-wage, middle-skill white-collar and blue-collar jobs. Concretely, employment and earnings are rising in both higheducation professional, technical, and managerial occupations and, since the late 1980s, in low-education food service, personal care, and protective service occupations. Conversely, job opportunities are declining in both middle-skill, whitecollar clerical, administrative, and sales occupations and in middle-skill, blue-collar production, craft, and operative occupations. The decline in middle-skill jobs has been detrimental to the earnings and labor force participation rates of workers without a four-year college education, and differentially so for males, who are increasingly concentrated in lowpaying service occupations.},

However, automation also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in labor supply. Journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor. Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been a "polarization" of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also argue, this polarization and is unlikely to continue very far into future. The final section of this paper reflects on how recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth. I argue that the interplay between machine and human comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing routine, codifiable tasks while amplifying the comparative advantage of workers in supplying problem-solving skills, adaptability, and creativity.},

Most of the studies are based on aggregated analyses that argue for or against such reforms in the policy regime. This study offers an alternative view to this debate based on a longitudinal empirical scrutiny of technological capability development in 46 local and foreign firms from three sectors in Northern Brazil. There were inter-sector and inter-firm variations in terms of the manner and rate of capability development for specific technical functions. Overall, the patterns of firm-level capability development exhibited a positive response to the structural reforms, but such responses were not a mere consequence of trade openness. A combination of government policy, foreign competition, and intra-firm capability building efforts proved essential for speeding up capability development in some of the sampled firms. Thus policies for accelerating industrial technological capability development in a developing area such as the one examined here would involve not only macro-level incentives and competition, but, very importantly, measures that facilitate intra-firm capability building efforts. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {I. Introduction Once upon a time, economists believed the developing world was full of market failures, and the only way in which poor countries could escape from their poverty traps was through forceful government interventions. Then there came a time when economists started to believe government failure was by far the bigger evil, and that the best thing that government could do was to give up any pretense of steering the economy. Reality has not been kind to either set of expectations. Import substitution, planning, and state ownership did produce some successes, but where they got entrenched and ossified over time, they led to colossal failures and crises. Economic liberalization and opening up benefited export activities, financial interests, and skilled workers, but more often than not, they resulted in economy-wide growth rates (in labor and total factor productivity) that fell far short of those experienced under the bad old policies of the past.},

These estimated relationships were used to simulate the likely effects of both past (1958-2008) and future (2008-2058) climate change.

This average, however, hides much larger losses in the already hot areas as well as substantial gains in currently cold areas. Similarly, the average impact on incomes is a modest reduction of 2.3 percent, but with some districts experiencing losses of up to 20 percent and others gains of up to 13 percent. Future climate change is estimated to cause an increase in poverty (all other things equal), but to have no significant effect on the distribution of incomes.},

The remaining of the paper estimates econometric models of growth convergence for municipal income per capita and labor productivity. From 1920 onwards analyses are refined, firstly, by disaggregating the models for urban and rural activities; secondly, by assuming spatial correlation among variables of the model; and, thirdly, by enlarging the model to take account of the long run determinants of spatial growth convergence. Empirical results endorse the historical preeminence of geographic factors – in particular accessibility and transport conditions – as opposed to institutional conditions.

This empirical study of the impact of the 1988--94 trade liberalization in Brazil on the industry wage structure suggests that although industry affiliation is an important component of worker earnings, the structure of industry wage premiums is relatively stable over time. There is no statistical association between changes in industry wage premiums and changes in trade policy or between industry-specific skill premiums to university graduates and trade policy. Thus trade liberalization in Brazil did not significantly contribute to increased wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers through changes in industry wage premiums. The difference between these results and those obtained for other countries (such as Colombia and Mexico) provides fruitful ground for studying the conditions under which trade reforms do not have an adverse effect on industry wage differentials.

abstract = {This paper studies trade-induced transitional dynamics by estimating a structural dynamic equilibrium model of the labor market. The model features a multi-sector economy with overlapping generations, heterogeneous workers, endogenous accumulation of sector-specific experience and costly switching of sectors. The estimation employs a large panel of workers constructed from Brazilian matched employer-employee data. The model's estimates yield high average costs of mobility that are very dispersed across the population. In addition, sector-specific experience is imperfectly transferable across sectors, leading to additional barriers to mobility. Using the estimated model as a laboratory for counterfactual experiments, this paper finds that: (1) there is a large labor market response following trade liberalization but the transition may take several years; (2) potential aggregate welfare gains are significantly mitigated due to the slow adjustment; (3) trade-induced welfare effects are very heterogeneous across the population; (4) retraining workers initially employed in the adversely affected sector may reduce losses incurred by these workers and increase aggregate welfare; (5) a moving subsidy that covers costs of mobility is more promising for compensating losers, although at the expense of higher welfare adjustment costs. The experiments also highlight the sensitivity of the transitional dynamics with respect to assumptions regarding the mobility of physical capital.},

abstract = {This article discusses how conflict patterns affect the volume, direction and types of migration within the developing world. Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in 'chronically vulnerable areas', which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Environmental migration is a topic which has given rise to widespread debate and gloomy predictions about the state of the world in 2050, but where rigorous research and empirical evidence are unfortunately in short supply. In this paper, we review the existing research on and empirical evidence of how climate change and climate variability in Less Developed Countries (LDCs) affects two main drivers of migration identified by migration models in the economic literature, namely income level differentials between origin and destination areas and income variability in origin areas, and how they in turn affect migration. We find that there are serious gaps in both the economic and the environmental literature that render it impossible to make sound and robust predictions of how climate change and increased climate variability will affect the economic migration drivers, and of how these in turn may change existing migration patterns. There are some empirical indications that income differentials may increase due to lower income levels in the origin areas of LDCs, but virtually no evidence exists of the effects of climate change or increased climate variability on income variability. Furthermore, although a negative relationship between migration and rainfall has been established by many researchers, there is only very limited evidence as to what drives it. A clearer picture of the driving force behind the link between rainfall and migration would greatly benefit policymaking in this area. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Moreover, we highlight a contrast between the short-run and long-run effects of migration on regional unemployment.

abstract = {Low-skill workers are comparatively immobile. When labor demand slumps in a city, college-educated workers tend to relocate whereas non-college workers are disproportionately likely to remain to face declining wages and employment. A standard explanation of these facts is that mobility is more costly for low-skill workers. This paper proposes and tests an alternative explanation, which is that the incidence of adverse shocks is borne in large part by (falling) real estate rental prices and (rising) social transfers. These factors reduce the real cost of living differentially for low-income workers and thus compensate them, in part or in full, for declining labor demand. I develop a spatial equilibrium model which, appropriately parameterized, identifies both the magnitude of unobserved mobility costs by skill and the shape of the local housing supply curve. Nonlinear reduced form estimates using U.S. Census data document that positive labor demand shocks increase population more than negative shocks reduce population, that this asymmetry is larger for low-skill workers, and that such an asymmetry is absent for wages, housing values, and rental prices. Estimates of the full model using a nonlinear, simultaneous equations GMM estimator suggest that (1) the asymmetric population response is primarily accounted for by an asymmetric housing supply curve, (2) the differential migration response by skill is primarily accounted for by transfer payments, and (3) estimated mobility costs are at most modest and are comparable for high-skill and low-skill workers, suggesting that the primary explanation for the comparative immobility of low-skilled workers is not higher mobility costs per se, but rather a lower incidence of adverse labor demand shocks.},

This gives rise to "compensating variations" in local wages and unemployment. However, for many occupations search is clearly conducted over logner distances from a home base. In the model presented in this paper, migration and unemployment are analysed both when the optimal search field is local, as in the traditional model, and when search is conducted over longer distances.

abstract = {This paper studies trade-induced transitional dynamics by estimating a structural dynamic equilibrium model of the labor market. The model features a multi-sector economy with overlapping generations, heterogeneous workers, endogenous accumulation of sector-specific experience and costly switching of sectors. The estimation employs a large panel of workers constructed from Brazilian matched employer-employee data. The model's estimates yield high average costs of mobility that are very dispersed across the population. In addition, sector-specific experience is imperfectly transferable across sectors, leading to additional barriers to mobility. Using the estimated model as a laboratory for counterfactual experiments, this paper finds that: (1) there is a large labor market response following trade liberalization but the transition may take several years; (2) potential aggregate welfare gains are significantly mitigated due to the slow adjustment; (3) trade-induced welfare effects are very heterogeneous across the population; (4) retraining workers initially employed in the adversely affected sector may reduce losses incurred by these workers and increase aggregate welfare; (5) a moving subsidy that covers costs of mobility is more promising for compensating losers, although at the expense of higher welfare adjustment costs. The experiments also highlight the sensitivity of the transitional dynamics with respect to assumptions regarding the mobility of physical capital.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the extent to which financial constraints limit international labor migration flows in a developing country context. Income growth in these settings can have two countervailing effects. Rising income may relax liquidity constraints that prevent profitable migration among poor households. However, higher income also implies smaller wage gaps with rich countries and a higher opportunity cost of migrating. Although acknowledged in the literature, existing theories make it difficult to disentangle these offsetting ef- fects empirically. I solve this difficulty by incorporating wealth heterogeneity, fixed migration costs, and dif- ferent types of income shocks into a microfounded model of village-level migration flows. Analytic solutions for village migration rates are obtained by exploiting observable heterogeneity in household landholdings, which follow a Pareto distribution. I then test for financial constraints in Indonesia using new administrative panel data on international migration from 66,000 villages. I capture income variation arising from transitory rainfall shocks and a large, sustained increase in domestic rice prices following an unanticipated ban on rice imports. Using a two-step estimator suggested by the theory, I find that positive agricultural income shocks are associated with significant increases in the share of village residents working abroad, particularly in vil- lages with a greater mass of small landholders. Migration flows are more responsive to rainfall shocks in underdeveloped villages—in terms of bank presence and other measures of baseline wealth levels. The em- pirical findings are consistent with the prevalence of binding financial constraints to labor mobility. I rule out aggregation bias using auxiliary survey data. Using the structural model, I show how financial constraints imply large interregional differences in potential future emigration flows. ∗I would like to thank my advisor, Gordon Hanson, for guidance and support.

We examine gross migration patterns during the entire postwar era using historical reports of the Current Population Survey, and supplement this analysis with statistics compiled by the Internal Revenue Service on inter-state and inter-metropolitan population flows since 1975. We find that internal migration within the U.S. is strongly procyclical, even after accounting for variation in relative local economic conditions. This procyclicality is common across most major demographic and labor force groups, although it is strongest for younger workers. Our findings suggest that cyclical fluctuations in internal migration are driven by economy-wide changes in the net cost to worker reallocation with a major role for the job finding rate of young workers.},

The overall goal of this paper is to understand the extent of and the factors driving urban expansion in China from the late 1980s to 2000. We use a unique three-period panel data set of high-resolution satellite imagery data and socioeconomic data for entire area of coterminous China. Consistent with a number of the key hypotheses generated by the monocentric model, our results demonstrate the powerful role that the growth of income has played in China's urban expansion. In some empirical models, the other key variables in the monocentric model-population, the value of agricultural land and transportation costs-also matter. Adapting the basic empirical model to account for the environment in developing countries, we also find that industrialization and the rise of the service sector appear to have affected the growth of the urban core, but their role was relatively small when compared to the direct effects of economic growth. We also make a methodological contribution, demonstrating the potential importance of accounting for unobserved fixed effects. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This study examines suburbanization in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Dalian. As a result of economic restructuring, the urban core registered net population loss from 1982 to 1990 because of decentralization while the inner suburbs gained population. Among the forces driving suburbanization were marketization of urban land, the shift of industrial land to tertiary use, transportation improvement, the availability of foreign and domestic capital, housing rehabilitation in the city, and new housing construction in the suburbs. There were certain similarities but major differences between American and Chinese suburbanization. Unlike the current metropolitan landscape in the United States where suburban growth has given rise to a polycentric spatial structure, suburbanization in China is still at the incipient stage of development with suburbs dominated by central cities. The role of the state in China has been more direct and powerful in setting the suburbanization process in motion.},

abstract = {China's spaces of urbanisation in the 1980s and early 1990s were occupied primarily by the interests of rural industrialisation and town development. Since the mid 1990s, China's urban spaces have been reproduced through a city-based and land-centred process of urbanisation in which large cities managed to reassert their leading positions in an increasingly competitive, globalising and urbanising economy. This study analyses changes in China's nonagricultural land in relation to the growth and structural changes of Chinese cities. A systematic analysis of three sets of data reveals a high intensity and great unevenness of non-agricultural land use in the country. China had 29.5 million hectares of non-agricultural land in 1996, which accounted for only 3 per cent of the national land mass. Over 80 per cent of the recent increase in non-agricultural land use was caused by the expansion of urban and rural settlements, industrialisation and numerous 'development zones'. A comparative analysis of land use data and Landsat images identifies two concurrent processes of urbanisation and non-agricultural land use change. Rapid urban sprawl of large cities, driven by the expansion of ring-roads and setting up of 'development zones', has contributed to the conversion of farmland into nonagricultural uses. At the same time, rural industrialisation and a housing boom have given rise to a dispersed pattern of non-agricultural land development all over the country. Given the pervasive influence of the forces of continuing urbanisation and globalisation, the state's attempt to protect China's dwindling farmland will not reverse the trend of increasing non-agricultural land use, but are likely to slow the pace of land conversion. Anecdotal evidence such as 'hollow villages' and idle land in numerous encircled 'development zones' suggests that there exist ways for China to use its non-agricultural land more efficiently and economically than hitherto.},

The policy had substantial impacts on the new administrative entities, including more discretionary power and fiscal independence. Such "county-to-city upgrading" provided the central government with an instrument to reward localities. Using a large dataset covering all counties during 1993-1997, I show that upgrading is not an automatic procedure that endorses the high urbanization levels in existing counties. Although official guidelines for upgrading counties to cities were published, these requirements were largely ignored in practice. Instead, economic growth rate was the key factor in determining which counties obtained city status. This paper interprets the creation of county-level cities through upgrading as part of the incentive structure of Chinese local officials. The importance of both fiscal and political incentives facing the local government in promoting economic growth is highlighted. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

In addition, the number of firms is growing faster in clustered areas than non-clustered ones.

abstract = {We provide the first multi-city, constant quality land price index for 35 major markets in China. While there is meaningful heterogeneity in land price growth across cities, on average the last nine years have seen land values skyrocket in many markets, not just those on or near the coast. The typical market has experienced double-digit compound average annual growth in real, constant-quality land values. The 2009-2010 stimulus period typically saw large surges in prices. Three notable characteristics about the land value appreciation series are their strong mean reversion at annual frequencies, the strong common factor in their movement, and their very high volatility. Quantities, not just prices, have been sharply increasing in recent years. The typical amount of space supplied via land auctions in our 35 city sample has doubled since 2008. Some local political economy traits such as the time the local Chinese Communist Party leader has been in office are correlated with land supply volume. We also investigate the quality of the two most prominent house price indexes in China, and conclude that a traditional hedonic index more accurately reflects how house prices have changed over time in eight major markets in China. Repeat sales indexes have become standard in many countries, but they are not as useful in emerging markets such as China because the bulk of the housing stock is relatively new and has not traded multiple times. A hedonic index shows much higher house price growth over time that do officially published series for the eight markets examined.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the recent trend of foreign direct investment in China's real estate market (FDIRE). It develops a panel regression model to examine the determinants of FDIRE in China. It incorporates a new explanatory variable to test the difference between FDIRE in coastal areas of China and in other areas. Such variable was never incorporated in models of previous studies. The result reveals that GDP per capita and the number of foreign real estate enterprises are the most significant factors affecting foreign investment in China's real estate market. This reflects that China's economic growth and its increasingly open market have a significant contribution to the rising trend in foreign investment in its real estate market. The newly incorporated regional factor COASTAL in the panel regression model shows that FDIRE in China still concentrates in coastal areas. However, there is more investment in those fast growing areas in recent years. It is suspected that FDIRE may overheat China's real estate market. Thus the Chinese government should monitor the real estate market carefully to stabilize the house price.},

abstract = {China's recent waves of internal migration, primarily rural to urban, reflect a rapidly urbanizing society undergoing a transition from a planned to a market economy. The author addresses two key questions: what access migrants have to urban housing and how migrant housing conditions compare with those of the locals. The main findings are based on citywide housing surveys and interviews conducted in Shanghai and Beijing, as well as results from official surveys. Interpretations of migrant housing patterns in urban China need to be linked with the country's unique institutional factors, particularly the circulating nature of migration, the existing household registration system, and the transitioning state of the urban housing market. Restricted access to urban housing, together with the temporary status for migrants, contributes to their poor housing conditions.},

abstract = {In the absence of democracy, credible federalist institutions, and a welfare state legacy what would motivate transfer payments from the federal to local level? By examining central transfer payments to Chinese counties, which deliver the bulk of the public goods, this paper discusses and tests an alternative set of motivations for transfer payments in autocracies. Given sufficient time horizon, the autocrat has strong incentive to pay off local defenders of the regime, as well as incentive to promote development through awarding growth and supporting education. In sharp contrast to democracies, however, autocracies have little incentive to transfer money to areas with higher shares of the elderly, since they do not vote and their contribution to long-term growth is discounted. We test these hypotheses on central and provincial transfer payments to Chinese counties between 1993 and 2003. Through GLS and 2SLS regressions with and without fixed effects, we consistently find that the size of the local government payroll has the largest impact on transfer payments, followed by the level of development and the share of school-age children. Contrary to robust findings in democracies, we find consistently that counties with higher share of the elderly receive no extra fiscal transfers.},

Until recently, however, there has been little systematic evidence with which to evaluate claims about the effects of transportation infrastructure on the development of cities and regions. In this paper, we describe the evolution of Chinese transportation infrastructure and how it relates to the evolution of location patterns of population and production in Chinese cities and surrounding regions. Using empirical evidence from our work with Loren Brandt, Vernon Henderson and Qinghua Zhang on the causal effects of various types of transportation infrastructure on the decentralization of Chinese cities, we evaluate the efficacy of various urban transport infrastructure policies for China. Finally, we put our results in context of the existing literature on the effects of infrastructure on productivity and the allocation of resources across locations.},

Because of the frictions, firms and workers find themselves in bilateral monopoly positions when determining wages. Although workers are not at each instant perfectly mobile across cities, in the baseline model we assume that workers flows are sufficient to equate expected utility across markets. We use the model to explore the joint determination of wages, unemployment, house prices and city size (or migration). A key role of the model is to clarify conditions under which this type of spatial equilibrium setup can be estimated. We then use U.S. data over the period 1970-2007 to explore the fit and quantitative properties of the model.

abstract = {It has been widely observed that China is under-urbanized. The central government has tried to use various policies to promote urbanization. In this paper, we evaluate one of these policies - count-to-city upgrading. Under China's hierarchical governance structure, a city status can only be determined and awarded by the central government. In the 1980s and 1990s, China adopted a formula-based county-to-city upgrading policy. Based on a large panel dataset covering all counties in China, we find that the formula was not strictly enforced in the practice. Moreover, jurisdictions that were upgraded to cities prior to 1998 do not perform better than their counterparts that remained county status in terms of both economic growth and providing public services. Largely because of these problems, this policy was called off in 1997. Given the strong need for urbanization, more indigenous institutional innovations are needed to find a viable way of creating cities, which would also provide compatible incentives to local governments. ?? 2012 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.},

abstract = {Many recent studies claim that China has reached a Lewisian 'turning point' in economic development, signalled by rising wages in urban areas and the exhaustion of rural surplus labour. In this paper we show that despite some evidence of rising nominal urban unskilled wages between 2000 and 2009, there is little in the data to suggest that this wage increase has been caused by unskilled labour shortages. China still has abundant under-employed workers with very low income in the rural sector. We argue that China's unique institutional and policy-induced barriers to migration have both prevented many rural workers from migrating to cities and also reduced the migrants' length of stay. We project that under alternative institutional settings, the migrant stock could easily be doubled from the current 150. million to 300. million by increasing either the average length of migrant stay, or the migrant inflow, or both. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The household registration (hukou) system in China, classifying each person as a rural or an urban resident, is a major means of controlling population mobility and determining eligibility for state-provided services and welfare. Established in the late 1950s, it was initially used to bar rural-to-urban migration. After the late 1970s reforms, an inflow of rural migrant workers was allowed into the cities to meet labor demands in the burgeoning export industries and urban services without, however, changing the migrants' registered status, thus precluding their access to subsidized housing and other benefits available to those with urban registration. While there have been many calls for reforming this system, progress has been limited. Proposed reforms have attracted increasing academic and media attention.},

abstract = {The success story of Chinese manufacturing in the last quarter-century is inextricably meshed with the story of migrant workers toiling for subsistence wages to produce goods for export. Indeed, the total stock of rural migrant labor, estimated to be about 155 million in 2010 (Cai et al. 2011: 18), has been the backbone of China's export industry since the mid-1990s. In export centers such as Shenzhen and Dongguan, migrant labor accounted for the great majority (70–80{\%}) of the labor force in the early years of the 21st century (Chan 2007). Rural–urban migration has also played a very important part in China's recent epic urbanization. In the 30 years since 1979 China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009 (Chan 2010c). Of the 440 million based on de facto urban population counts, the increase of about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification (for estimates of components and definitions, see Chan {\&} Hu 2003; Chan 2007). The latest urban population count, based on the 2010 census, was 666 million in November 2010 (NBS 2011). Even if only half of that increase was due to migration, the volume of rural–urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history. The latest urban population count, based on the 2010 census, was 666 million in November 2010 (NBS 2011).},

abstract = {This paper presents and assesses of the contribution of inward FDI to China's recent rapid economic growth using a two stage growth accounting approach. Recent econometric literature focuses on testing whether Chinese growth depends on inward FDI rather than measuring the contribution. Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs), often (but not exclusively) are joint ventures between foreign companies and Chinese enterprises, and can be thought of as forming a distinctive subpart of the Chinese economy. These enterprises account for over 50{\%} of China's exports and 60{\%} of China's imports. Their share in Chinese GDP has been over 20{\%} in the last two years, but they employ only 3{\%} of the workforce, since their average labor productivity exceeds that of Non-FIEs by around 9:1. Their production is more heavily for export rather than the domestic market because FIEs provide access to both distribution systems abroad and product design for export markets. Our decomposition results indicate that China's FIEs may have contributed over 40{\%} of China's economic growth in 2003 and 2004, and without this inward FDI, China's overall GDP growth rate could have been around 3.4 percentage points lower. We suggest that the sustainability of both China' export and overall economic growth may be questionable if inward FDI plateaus in the future. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This chapter presents a discussion on the patterns of structural transformation during the transition from a low income, agrarian rural economy to an industrial urban economy with substantially higher per capita income. The chapter presents a review on the basic concepts of the empirical research program into the economic structure of developing countries during the transition process, which originated with the monumental work of Simon Kuznets. The chapter discusses methodological issues of empirical research on structural transformation. A summary of the main stylized facts of development, with emphasis on growth, accumulation, and sector proportions is presented. Attempts to model and explain the transformation are also presented. The chapter also discusses relative prices and the role of the state in facilitating, fostering, or at times hampering, an efficient transformation. Development economics can be characterized as dealing with issues of structure and growth in less developed countries. Analysis of structure appears in two variants. The first, and more recent, is concerned with the functioning of economies, their markets, institutions, mechanisms for allocating resources, income generation and its distribution, and so on. In the second variant, economic development is seen as an interrelated set of long-run processes of structural transformation that accompany growth. The central features of this approach are economy-wide phenomena such as industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural transformation, regarded as elements of what Kuznets identified as “modern economic growth.”},

abstract = {China's economic success story in the last three decades cannot be separated from its plentiful supply of migrant labour from the rural areas in the hinterland to cities along the coast (Scott, 2006; Fallows, 2007). Despite the great interest by academics, the media and the public in general (Davin, 1999; Fan, 2008), the analysis of migration trends in China continues to be plagued by problems in interpreting statistics and by inconsistencies in key data over time (Goodkind and West, 2004; Liang and Ma, 2004). Also, the underlying concepts China uses to define migration flows are different from those used in other countries and are sometimes misinterpreted. As will be explained in the following sections of this paper, the analysis of internal migration patterns in China is further complicated by the particular institutional arrangements and systems of population and migration management, and of statistical reporting (Scharping, 2001; Chan, 2007). Because of the difficulties in obtaining complete information of migrant flows, Roberts (2002) refers to migrants as “invisible residents.” In order to provide a clear picture of recent migration trends and flows and the policies that impact them in China, this paper reviews and synthesizes data from a large number of sources, building on the previous works by Mallee (1998), Liu and Chan (2001), and Chan (2001; 2007). The first part tackles data issues and examines trends and patterns. The second part looks at two areas of policy importance to migration: migration and regional disparities; and migration and the reforms of the hukou system, aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the migration dynamics and complexities in China. The paper discusses the importance of internal migration in reducing regional economic disparities in the last two decades and recommends more reforms of the hukou system to help promote migration and protect migrants' rights.},

abstract = {DT n° 2014-16, September 2014
We study how the 2004 reform of minimum wage rules in China has affected the survival, average wage, employment and productivity  of local firms.  To identify the causal effect of minimum wage growth, we use firm-level data for more than 160,000 manufacturing firms active in 2003 and complement the triple difference estimates with an IV strategy that builds on the institutional features of the 2004 reform. We find that the increase in city-level minimum wages resulted in lower survival probability for firms that were the most exposed to the reform. For surviving firms, wage costs increased without negative repercussions on employment. The main explanation for this finding is that  productivity significantly improved, allowing firms to absorb the cost shock without hurting their employment nor their profitability. At the city-level, our results show that  higher  minimum wages fostered aggregate productivity  growth thanks to productivity  improvements of incumbent firms and net entry of more productive ones. Hence, in a fast-growing economy like China, there is a cleansing effect of labor market standards. Minimum wage growth allows more productive firms to replace the least productive ones and forces incumbent firms to strengthen their competitiveness, these two mechanisms boosting the aggregate efficiency of the economy.},

abstract = {This chapter considers the linkages between agricultural development and rural non-farm activities. The chapter is motivated by growing evidence that non-farm activities provide an increasingly important share of rural incomes in many low-income questions, questions about whether increasing agricultural productivity is a necessary precondition for raising incomes and reducing poverty in rural areas, and increased evidence of factor and commodity flows between rural and urban areas. Unfortunately, the existing literature is sparse and has not been sufficiently attentive to the underlying structures and mechanisms that drive the relationship between agricultural productivity and rural non-farm change. A particular weakness of this literature is the lack of attention given to the importance of flows of both capital and labor. The reason for this is in part due to the limitations of existing data. An assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of existing data sets is thus also provided, with particular attention to panel data sets that might be useful for assessing the extent of geographic mobility. In order to clarify the relevant issues the Chapter presents a model of the rural economy that permits examination of the linkages between agricultural development and non-farm employment under different regimes distinguished by the mobility of capita and labor. Basic features of the model are then tested using newly available data from South Asia. The Chapter concludes with suggestions for future data collection efforts as well as the development of more sophisticated models of the rural economy. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The wage curve-approach, which explicitly shows how disparities in real wages and unemployment rates are interrelated, can not endogenously explain the origin of these asymmetries. In the article we derive a theoretical model that com- bines these two strings in the literature. We show that a core-periphery in real wages is associated with and magnified by regional unemployment disparities. This wage curve relation is stable over time with an increasing returns technol- ogy. That is, the wage curve does not vanish as workers move from the periph- ery to the core, but it is rather reinforced by migration. These theoretical predictions are consistent with stylised empirical facts from the EU.},

This paper concerns factor income taxation and public good provision in small open economies characterized by capital mobility and imperfect competition in the labor market. We assume that each national government collects public revenues via taxes on capital and profit income, and that the revenues are spent on a public consumption good and a public input good, where the latter enters the economic system in terms of an 'externality production factor'. We show that tax coordination contributes to higher welfare even if the labor market is noncompetitive. However, the relative overprovision of the public input good derived by Keen and Marchand [Keen, M., Marchand, M., 1997. Fiscal competition and the pattern of public spending.

abstract = {Previous research on unemployment insurance (UI) has focused on the costs of the program, in terms of the distorting effects of generous UI benefits on worker and firm behavior. For assessing the optimal size of an unemployment insurance program, however, it is also important to gauge the benefits of increased UI generosity, in terms of smoothing consumption across periods of joblessness. I do so through a reduced form approach which directly measures the effect of legislated variations in UI benefits on consumption changes among individuals becoming unemployed. I use annual observations on food consumption expenditures for 1968-1987 from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, matched to information on the UI benefits for which unemployed persons were eligible in each state and year. I estimate that a 10 percentage point increase in the UI replacement rate leads to a consumption fall upon unemployment which is 2.7{\%} smaller. Over this period, the average fall in consumption for the unemployed was 7{\%}; my results imply that, in the absence of unemployment insurance, this fall would have been over three times as large. I also find that the positive effect of UI only extends for one period, smoothing consumption during initial job loss but having no permanent effect on consumption levels; that individuals who anticipate layoff see a smaller consumption smoothing effect; and that UI appears to somewhat crowd out other forms of public consumption insurance. Despite the substantial estimated consumption smoothing effect, however, my results imply that the optimal UI benefit level is within the range of current replacement rates only at fairly high levels of risk aversion.},

We use the model to explore the joint determination of wages, unemployment, house prices and city size (or migration). A key role of the model is to clarify conditions under which this type of spatial equilibrium setup can be estimated. We then use U.S. data over the period 1970-2007 to explore the fit and quantitative properties of the model.

However, this approach suffers from several econometric problems, which we address with semiparametric methods. The resulting formal premium estimates prove either small and insignificant, or negative. Neither do we find significant differences in measures of job satisfaction between the two sectors.

abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, it reviews the model of search and matching equilibrium and derives the properties of employment and unemployment equilibrium. Second, it applies the model to the study of employment fluctuations and to the explanation of differences in unemployment rates in industrialized countries. The search and matching model is built on the assumptions of a time-consuming matching technology that determines the rate of job creation given the unmatched number of workers and jobs; and on a stochastic arrival of idiosyncratic shocks that determines the rate of job destruction given the wage contract between matched firms and workers. The outcome is a model for the flow of new jobs and unemployed workers from inactivity to production (the 'job creation' flow) and one for the flow of workers from employment to unemployment and of jobs out of the market (the 'job destruction' flow). Steady-state equilibrium is at the point where the two flows are equal. The model is shown to explain well the employment fluctuations observed in the US economy, within the context of a real business cycle model. It is also shown that the large differences in unemployment rates observed in industrialized countries can be attributed to a large extent to differences in policy towards employment protection legislation (which increases the duration of unemployment and reduces the flow into unemployment) and the generosity of the welfare state (which reduces job creation). It is argued that on the whole European countries have been more generous in their unemployment support policies and in their employment protection legislation than the USA. The chapter also surveys other reasons given in the literature for the observed levels in unemployment, including mismatch and real interest rates. ?? 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Even after adjusting industry wage differentials for differences in measured labor force skills and other traits, the variation in the measure of labor rents across manufacturing industries is about 2-3 times as large as the variation in aftertax profit rates.  Hall feels that the concept of agglomeration should be important in explaining variations in economic activity over time, across countries, and across industries.  Schultze says that some of the differentials may arise from ability differentials not correlated with observable characteristics.

Our approach to computing equilibria is based on Rosen's (1974) bid function. It has four desirable features: (i) convergence implies a hedonic equilibrium; (ii) convergence is guaranteed if a hedonic equilibrium exists; (iii) it can solve for a new equilibrium following a shock to the market; and (iv) if multiple equilibria exist, it can identify them. The algorithm is applied to micro data from San Joaquin County, California, where the choice of a home provides access to public schools in particular school districts. First we calibrate the algorithm to approximately reproduce actual housing prices in San Joaquin County as a hedonic equilibrium. Then we introduce a policy that improves school quality in selected school districts. We find that there are several possibilities for the new equilibrium. For each of these potential equilibria, we compare the marginal willingness to pay for school quality with the rate at which the improvement is capitalized into property values. The resulting capitalization rates differ substantially from marginal willingness to pay. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The first main substantive section presents the essence of multisector modeling, in particular, the role of labor market dualism. Given that labor markets often consist of quite distinct segments, a useful and insightful analytical approach is to start with just two interrelated segments. The second main substantive section is on models of wages and employment in the formal economy. This section covers 1) the market-clearing labor market model and the presumed equilibrating forces, 2) above-market-clearing wages set institutionally, 3) above-market-clearing wages set by efficiency wage considerations, and 4) above-market-clearing wages set by worker behavior. The third main substantive section is on wages and employment in the informal economy. This section presents three characterizations of informal sector labor markets: 1) the informal economy as a free-entry sector that prospective workers enter only as a last resort, 2) the informal economy as a desirable sector that workers choose in preference to formal sector work, and 3) the informal economy with its own internal dualism, combining 1) and 2).

Then, it presents cross-country empirical evidence that analyzes, first, the differential poverty-reducing impact of sectoral growth at various levels of disaggregation, and, second, the role of unskilled labor intensity in such differential impact. The paper finds evidence that not only the size of economic growth but also its composition matters for poverty alleviation, with the largest contributions from unskilled labor-intensive sectors (agriculture, construction, and manufacturing). The results are robust to the influence of outliers, endogeneity concerns, alternative explanations, and various poverty measures. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For many problems in macroeconomics, development economics, labour economics, and international trade, whether technical change is biased towards particular factors is of central importance. This paper develops a simple framework to analyse the forces that shape these biases. There are two major forces affecting equilibrium bias: the price effect and the market size effect. While the former encourages innovations directed at scarce factors, the latter leads to technical change favouring abundant factors. The elasticity of substitution between different factors regulates how powerful these effects are, determining how technical change and factor prices respond to changes in relative supplies. If the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently large, the long run relative demand for a factor can slope up. I apply this framework to develop possible explanations to the following questions: why technical change over the past 60 years was skill biased, and why the skill bias may have accelerated over the past 25 years? Why new technologies introduced during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were unskill biased? What is the effect of biased technical change on the income gap between rich and poor countries? Does international trade affect the skill bias of technical change? What are the implications of wage push for technical change? Why is technical change generally labour augmenting rather than capital augmenting?

Agglomeration economies and human capital spillovers suggest that such policies could enhance welfare. However, the mere existence of agglomeration externalities does not indicate which places should be subsidized. Without a better understanding of nonlinearities in these externalities, any government spatial policy is as likely to reduce as to increase welfare. Transportation spending has historically done much to make or break particular places, but current transportation spending subsidizes low-income, low-density places where agglomeration effects are likely to be weakest. Most large-scale place-oriented policies have had little discernable impact. Some targeted policies such as Empowerment Zones seem to have an effect but are expensive relative to their achievements. The greatest promise for a national place-based policy lies in impeding the tendency of highly productive areas to restrict their own growth through restrictions on land use.},

The findings support the theoretical prediction. Kibbutz-leavers are more skilled than both stayers and other rural migrants and they earn higher wages upon exit than observably similar city natives and other migrants. In contrast, individuals who earn lower wages in the city are more likely to enter a kibbutz, but they are not more likely to move to other rural areas.

abstract = {Sjaastad (1962) viewed migration in the same way as education: as an investment in the human agent. Migration and education are decisions that are indeed intertwined in many dimensions. Education and skill acquisition play an important role at many stages of an individuals migration. Differential returns to skills in origin and destination country are a main driver of migration. The economic success of the immigrant in the destination country is to a large extent determined by his or her educational background, how transferable these skills are to the host country labor market and how much he or she invests in further skills after arrival. The desire to acquire skills in the host country that have a high return in the country of origin may be another important reason for a migration. From an intertemporal point of view, the possibility of a later migration may affect educational decisions in the home country long before a migration is realized. In addition, the decisions of migrants regarding their own educational investment and their expectations about future migration plans may affect the educational attainment of their children. But migration and education are not only related for those who migrate or their descendants. Migrations of some individuals may have consequences for educational decisions of those who do not migrate, both in the home and in the host country. By easing credit constraints through remittances, migration of some may help others to go to school. By changing the skill base of the receiving country, migration may change incentives to invest in certain types of human capital. In addition, migrants and their children may create externalities that influence educational outcomes of nonmigrants in the destination country. This chapter will discuss some of the key areas that connect migration and education. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper establishes the cyclical properties of a novel measure of worker reallocation: long-distance migration rates within the U.S. This internal migration offers a bird's eye view of worker reallocation in the economy, as long-distance migrants often change jobs or employment status. We examine gross migration patterns during the entire postwar era using historical reports of the Current Population Survey, and supplement this analysis with statistics compiled by the Internal Revenue Service on inter-state and inter-metropolitan population flows since 1975. We find that internal migration within the U.S. is strongly procyclical, even after accounting for variation in relative local economic conditions. This procyclicality is common across most major demographic and labor force groups, although it is strongest for younger workers. Our findings suggest that cyclical fluctuations in internal migration are driven by economy-wide changes in the net cost to worker reallocation with a major role for the job finding rate of young workers.},

Although a convincing explanation for the secular decline in migration remains elusive and requires further research, we find only limited roles for the housing market contraction and the economic recession in reducing migration recently.

Our model incorporates duration dependence in several variables, multiple sources of unobserved heterogeneity, job-specific error components in both wages and hours, and measurement error. We use the model to address a number of important questions in labor economics, including the source of the experience profile of wages, the response of job changes to outside wage offers, and the effects of seniority on job changes. We provide estimates of the dynamic response of wage rates, hours, and earnings to various shocks and measure the relative contributions of the shocks to the variance of earnings in a given year and over a lifetime. We find that human capital accounts for most of the growth of earnings over a career although job seniority and job mobility also play significant roles. Unemployment shocks have a large impact on earnings in the short run as well a substantial long long-term effect that operates through the wage rate. Shocks associated with job changes and unemployment make a large contribution to the variance of career earnings and operate mostly through the job-specific error components in wages and hours.{\textless}P{\textgreater}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {I examine the causes and the consequences of differences in labor market outcomes across local labor markets within a country. The focus is on a long-run general equilibrium setting, where workers and firms are free to move across localities and local prices adjust to maintain the spatial equilibrium. In particular, I develop a tractable general equilibrium framework of local labor markets with heterogenous labor. This framework is useful in thinking about differences in labor market outcomes of different skill groups across locations. It clarifies how, in spatial equilibrium, localized shocks to a part of the labor market propagate to the rest of the economy through changes in employment, wages and local prices and how this diffusion affects workers' welfare. Using this framework, I address three related questions. First, I analyze the welfare consequences of productivity differences across local labor markets. I seek to understand what happens to the wage, employment and utility of workers with different skill levels when a local economy experiences a shift in the productivity of a group of workers. Second, I analyze the causes of productivity differences across local labor markets. To a large extent, productivity differences within a country are unlikely to be exogenous. I review the theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration economies, with a particular focus on studies that are relevant for labor economists. Finally, I discuss the implications for policy. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The use of the informal sector concept in the ILO World Employment Programme studies at country, city and sector level is discussed and definitional confusions in different conceptualizations are identified. Recognition of the essentially dependent and involutionary nature of the informal sector has resulted in critical concern with the limitations of this dualist model, both as a theoretical concept and as a basis for policy recommendations. An alternative more satisfactory model is presented, based on petty commodity production and its subordinate relationship to the capitalist sector. In identifying a continuum of productive activities, with complex linkages and dependent relationships, the dynamics of production and constraints on expansion are distinguished. Clarification as to whether the linkages are benign or exploitative is essential in order to assess whether petty commodity production is tolerated by or functional to, the capitalist system.},

abstract = {Low-skill workers are comparatively immobile. When labor demand slumps in a city, college-educated workers tend to relocate whereas non-college workers are disproportionately likely to remain to face declining wages and employment. A standard explanation of these facts is that mobility is more costly for low-skill workers. This paper proposes and tests an alternative explanation, which is that the incidence of adverse shocks is borne in large part by (falling) real estate rental prices and (rising) social transfers. These factors reduce the real cost of living differentially for low-income workers and thus compensate them, in part or in full, for declining labor demand. I develop a spatial equilibrium model which, appropriately parameterized, identifies both the magnitude of unobserved mobility costs by skill and the shape of the local housing supply curve. Nonlinear reduced form estimates using U.S. Census data document that positive labor demand shocks increase population more than negative shocks reduce population, that this asymmetry is larger for low-skill workers, and that such an asymmetry is absent for wages, housing values, and rental prices. Estimates of the full model using a nonlinear, simultaneous equations GMM estimator suggest that (1) the asymmetric population response is primarily accounted for by an asymmetric housing supply curve, (2) the differential migration response by skill is primarily accounted for by transfer payments, and (3) estimated mobility costs are at most modest and are comparable for high-skill and low-skill workers, suggesting that the primary explanation for the comparative immobility of low-skilled workers is not higher mobility costs per se, but rather a lower incidence of adverse labor demand shocks.},

Two approaches are distinguished. First, one which assumes that benign relationships between sectors prevail, and second, one which assumes that subordination is the main characteristic of informal activities. An additional distinction can be introduced in each case according to the degree of integration of economic activities. The paper offers an intermediate conceptual framework of heterogeneous subordin- ation which implies a subordinated relationship for the sector as a whole, but resulting from different processes occurring within it. It is suggested that given such a theoretical framework, we should expect a declining trend in the share of income for the informal sector as a whole, but this will not imply that the sector will disappear. This, together with the anticipated expansion of labour supply for the sector. allows that if no measures are taken, involutionary growth will occur. The},

This paper investigates congruence between three empirical measures of the rate of informality using Brazilian household survey data for the period 1992-2004. Sixty-three percent of the economically active are informal according to at least one definition, but only 40{\%} are informal according to all three. Regression analysis is used to shed further light on differences in these measures. Appropriate measurement is therefore of high significance to policy analysis and design of appropriate strategies to reduce informality. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The region has trailed most other world regions over the past half century despite relatively high initial development and school attainment levels. This puzzle, however, can be resolved by considering educational achievement, a direct measure of human capital. We introduce a new, more inclusive achievement measure that comes from splicing regional achievement tests into worldwide tests. In growth regressions, the positive growth effect of educational achievement fully accounts for the poor growth performance of Latin American countries. These results are confirmed in a number of instrumental-variable specifications that exploit plausibly exogenous achievement variation stemming from historical and institutional determinants of educational achievement. Finally, a development accounting analysis finds that, once educational achievement is included, human capital can account for between half and two thirds of the income differences between Latin America and the rest of the world. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

While existing new economic geography (NEG) models could not explicitly analyze the relationship due to their assumptions, I construct a new NEG-type model allowing for different location dynamics of firms and skilled labor for this objective. The main results are as follows. First, a relatively large pool of skilled labor attracts firms when trade costs are small, while it might repel firms when trade costs are sufficiently large. Second, assuming that skilled workers are mobile between regions, the model shows that skilled workers agglomerate faster than firms with decreasing trade costs. Third, the model supports the hypothesis that firms follow skilled labor rather than the reverse. These results are consistent to Indian and Chinese experiences, and some “creative-class” or “skilled-city” stories.},

abstract = {State socialist economies provided public housing to urban citizens at nominal cost, while allocating larger and better quality apartments to individuals in elite occupations. In transitions to a market economy, ownership is typically transferred to existing occupants at deeply discounted prices, making home equity the largest component of household wealth. Housing privatization is therefore a potentially important avenue for the conversion of bureaucratic privilege into private wealth. We estimate the resulting inequalities with data from successive waves of a Chinese national income survey that details household assets and participation in housing programs. Access to privatization programs was relatively equal across urban residents in state sector occupations. Elite occupations had substantially greater wealth in the form of home equity shortly after privatization, due primarily to their prior allocations of newer and higher quality apartments. The resulting gaps in private wealth were nonetheless small by the standards of established market economies, and despite the inherent biases in the process, housing privatization distributed home equity widely across those who were resident in public housing immediately prior to privatization.},

abstract = {China's floating population is one of the most mobile populations in the world. Most of its members take the temporary form of migration, and maintain their double (rural and urban) residential status. In recent years, great efforts have been made to reform the household registration (Hukou) system, which has been regarded as the central mechanism underlying the unsettled nature of the floating population, in the hope that they will settle down in the cities and be fully integrated into China's urbanization process. However, the effect of such reform has been limited. Based on a theoretical framework and empirical evidence from a survey, this paper argues that the temporary nature of the floating population is a result of not only the Hukou system, but also the combined effects of the intrinsic demand of the industrial society for temporary migrants, the household strategy of migrants to diversify and maximize economic opportunities and spread economic risk, and certain conditions of the current stage of development. The paper draws policy implications from the analysis, calling for policies not only to facilitate permanent settlement of migrants in the cities but also catering for their needs arising from the temporary form of migration, and their potential roles in the development of their hometowns. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Inspired by the case of China, this paper develops a spatial agglomeration model to explain the increasing regional disparity in China and explore several policy implications. The model shows that the improving trade condition and the increasing rural-to-urban labor mobility in China may be the reasons for the enlarging income gap between the coastal area and the hinterland. With a geographical advantage in international trade, the coast becomes the initial location for industrial agglomeration and its leadership becomes strengthened by the positive feedback mechanism from increasing returns to scale. The necessary labor supply for industrial agglomeration in the coast comes from intraregional rural-to-urban migration instead of interregional migration. As a consequence of the industrial agglomeration, the income disparity between the coast and the hinterland increases. The location disadvantage of the interior comes from higher transportation cost in international trade. However, the model suggests that increasing domestic accessibility can actually make the interior worse off. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Until recently, however, there has been little systematic evidence with which to evaluate claims about the effects of transportation infrastructure on the development of cities and regions. In this paper, we describe the evolution of Chinese transportation infrastructure and how it relates to the evolution of location patterns of population and production in Chinese cities and surrounding regions. Using empirical evidence from our work with Loren Brandt, Vernon Henderson and Qinghua Zhang on the causal effects of various types of transportation infrastructure on the decentralization of Chinese cities, we evaluate the efficacy of various urban transport infrastructure policies for China. Finally, we put our results in context of the existing literature on the effects of infrastructure on productivity and the allocation of resources across locations.},

Japan has excellent data and relatively uniform institutions since World War II, which allow us to track its spatial evolution and detail its key features today. For Japan we show how structural shifts in the national economy involved major transformations of the regional structure of economic activity. We address a central policy issue, the high extent of urban agglomeration in Tokyo. Then we turn to the details of the spatial distribution of industrial activity across cities, to see what general patterns hold and what they imply for our understanding of the role of different cities in the urban hierarchy. For China the approach is different. With the radical institutional changes since 1978 moving China away from being a planned economy, there is little consistency in data definitions and coverage over time and less detailed data are available. We focus on the last decade and on policy issues. We observe that Chinese cities tend to be over- capitalized and undersized, with strong spatial biases to policies, concerning migration, capital allocations, infrastructure allocations and location of FDI.},

abstract = {China had separate rural and urban labor markets for about 40 years until the late 1980's when the restrictions on rural–urban migration were gradually eased. By the end of the 1980's and in the early 1990's, the number of rural migrants working in the urban areas began to increase dramatically. However, rural migrants are treated differently from their urban counterparts in terms of occupational attainment and wages. This paper utilizes two comparable survey data sets to analyze the degree to which the segregation between rural migrants and urban residents has occurred from the point of view of occupational segregation and wage differentials. A significant difference in occupational attainment and wages exists between rural migrants and urban residents. Most of the difference cannot be explained by productivity-related differences between the two groups, implying that urban residents are favorably treated while their migrant counterparts are discriminated against.

abstract = {Most studies on discrimination against migrants in Chinese cities focus on wage differentials. This paper endeavours to develop an alternative way of explaining the institutional discrimination against migrants by studying workers' job mobility rates in three cities: Beijing, WuXi and Zhuhai. Migrants are commonly perceived to have high occupational mobility; however, Cox proportional hazards regressions in this paper show a different picture. Institutional discrimination reduces the number of jobs available to the migrants, increases their job search costs and the cost of losing jobs. Even though migrants take jobs unacceptable to local residents, the effects of this institutional discrimination still constrain migrants in changing jobs. The regressions show that temporary migrants have longer job durations and shorter unemployment durations than local people or permanent migrants. Moreover, migrants start to change jobs more often only after they have stayed in the city for some time and have accumulated enough assets to be able to survive when unemployed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Exports of more "sophisticated" products appear to be positively correlated with growth, and upgrading the quality of exports is high on the policy agenda of many countries. This study presents evidence suggesting that attracting inflows of FDI offers potential for raising the quality of exports in developing countries. Our empirical analysis relates unit values of exports measured at the 4-digit SITC level to data on sectors treated by investment promotion agencies as priority in their efforts to attract FDI. The sample covers 105 countries over the period 1984-2000. The findings are consistent with a positive effect of FDI on unit values of exports in developing countries. The evidence for high income economies is ambiguous. When we examine the link between FDI and the overlap between the export structure of developing and high income economies ("export sophistication"), we find no evidence of FDI increasing the similarity of export structure between the two groups.},

Our aim is to inject economic modelling into the debate on sources of inequality in China which thus far has been largely statistical. We first use a model with homogeneous labour in which wage inequality across various geographical divides in China is supported solely by quantity based migration restrictions (urban-rural areas, rich-poor regions, eastern-central and western (non-coastal) zones, eastern and central-western development zones, eastern-central-western zones, more disaggregated 6 regional classifications, and an all 31 provincial classification). We calibrate this model to base case data and when we remove migration restrictions all wage and most income inequality disappears. Results from this model structure points to a significant role for Hukou restrictions in supporting inequality in China. We then present a further model extension in which urban house price rises retard rural-urban migration. The impacts of removing Hukou restrictions on migration are smaller, but are still significant. Finally, we modify the model to capture labour productivity differences across regions, calibrating the modified model to estimates of both national and regional Gini coefficients. Removal of migration barriers is again inequality improving but less so. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

They have fewer years of education, are less likely to hold state sector jobs and to have employer-provided healthcare benefits, and are more likely to be self-employed or unemployed. A rural-urban comparison that controls for factors commonly believed to affect migration decision reveals that the two major contributing factors to rural-urban inequality are low educational attainment among rural population and low rewards to education in rural employment. Since the hukou system denies rural population the access to education and urban employment, we argue that the hukou system is a major contributing factor to rural-urban inequality.

This paper argues that these intra-sector restrictions lead to insufficient agglomeration of economic activity in both the rural industrial and urban sectors, with resulting first order losses in GDP. For urban areas the paper estimates a city productivity relationship, based on city GDP numbers. The effects of access, educational attainment, FDI, and public infrastructure on productivity are estimated. Given these, worker productivity is shown to be an inverted U-shape function of city employment, with the peak point shifting out as industrial composition moves from manufacturing to services, as predicted by urban theory. As far as we know this is the first paper to actually estimate the relationship between output per worker and city scale for any country. The majority of Chinese cities are shown to be potentially undersized-below the lower bound on the 95{\%} confidence interval about the size where their output per worker peaks.

abstract = {This paper constructs a theoretical labor market model for China, and utilizes the model to examine the effects of various labor market policies on economic well-being. Two key features of the model are a segmented labor market involving three sectors – state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and agriculture – and China's unique household registration system (hukou). The major existing theoretical models of employment and development – the Lewis model, the integrated labor market model, the Harris-Todaro model, and various segmented labor market models – stylize different developing countries' labor markets in other ways but do not include these two key features. The paper first formulates the equations of the model, then obtains a closed form solution given initial conditions, and then deduces the labor market and welfare consequences of several policy interventions, which include promoting rural development, reducing the cost-of-living in urban areas for rural hukou holders, and offering some rural workers the chance to convert from rural to urban hukou status. These policy interventions are analyzed using two alternative welfare criteria: first-order stochastic dominance and an abbreviated social welfare function. Using both social welfare criteria, it is shown that the rural development policy is unambiguously welfare-improving, while the other two policies have ambiguous effects on social welfare. None of these policies is unambiguously welfare-decreasing.},

abstract = {In this article, we explore the issue of industrial agglomeration and its relationship to economic development and growth in the less-developed countries of East Asia. We present theoretical arguments and secondary empirical evidence as to why we should have strong expectations about finding a positive relationship between agglomeration and economic performance. We also review evidence from the literature on the roles of formal and informal institutions in East Asian regional economic systems. We then focus specifically on the case of China. We argue that regional development in China has much in common with regional development in other East Asian economies, although there are also important contrasts because of China's history of socialism and its recent trend toward economic liberalization. Through a variety of statistical investigations, we substantiate (in part) the expected positive relationship between agglomeration and economic performance in China. We show that many kinds of manufacturing sectors are characterized by a strong positive relationship between spatial agglomeration and productivity. This phenomenon is especially marked in sectors and regions where liberalization has proceeded rapidly. We consider the relevance of our comments about industrial clustering and economic performance for policy formulation in China and the less-developed countries of East Asia.

abstract = {The household registration (hukou) system in China, classifying each person as a rural or an urban resident, is a major means of controlling population mobility and determining eligibility for state-provided services and welfare. Established in the late 1950s, it was initially used to bar rural-to-urban migration. After the late 1970s reforms, an inflow of rural migrant workers was allowed into the cities to meet labor demands in the burgeoning export industries and urban services without, however, changing the migrants' registered status, thus precluding their access to subsidized housing and other benefits available to those with urban registration. While there have been many calls for reforming this system, progress has been limited. Proposed reforms have attracted increasing academic and media attention.},

We study how the 2004 reform of minimum wage rules in China has affected the survival, average wage, employment and productivity  of local firms.  To identify the causal effect of minimum wage growth, we use firm-level data for more than 160,000 manufacturing firms active in 2003 and complement the triple difference estimates with an IV strategy that builds on the institutional features of the 2004 reform. We find that the increase in city-level minimum wages resulted in lower survival probability for firms that were the most exposed to the reform. For surviving firms, wage costs increased without negative repercussions on employment. The main explanation for this finding is that  productivity significantly improved, allowing firms to absorb the cost shock without hurting their employment nor their profitability. At the city-level, our results show that  higher  minimum wages fostered aggregate productivity  growth thanks to productivity  improvements of incumbent firms and net entry of more productive ones. Hence, in a fast-growing economy like China, there is a cleansing effect of labor market standards. Minimum wage growth allows more productive firms to replace the least productive ones and forces incumbent firms to strengthen their competitiveness, these two mechanisms boosting the aggregate efficiency of the economy.},

abstract = {Rural-urban migration flows are a crucial corollary of economic development. The adverse or beneficial effects of internal migration, for sending as well as receiving areas, and the definition of optimal migration policies, have remained much discussed issues since the seminal works of Harris and Todaro (1970). This debate is especially acute in China where the "household registration system" (hukou) acts as a strong constraint on individual migration. This paper aims to assess the consequences of hukou through a simple model of a developing dual economy with overlapping generations. Contrary to existing studies focused on the contemporaneous allocation of economic resources, it deals with the dynamic consequences of migration flows and migration policies. It shows that, in fairly general circumstances, hukou-related migration constraints can actually hasten development, understood as the transfer of the labor force to the modern sector, driven by capital accumulation. The hukou system could thus be one of the causes of the extremely high Chinese saving rate and of the high pace of Chinese development. Insights from the model are confronted with stylized facts from the Chinese development, and theoretical results are especially consistent with the effects of the 2001 "towns and small cities" reform. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Review all documentation and other company records considered when making the decision. Make sure all stated policies were followed by management. 2. Interview all managers who provided input on the decisions. 3. Be satisfied that the decision was made for the correct reason. 4. Was the employee aware that termination was likely? Can you document that awareness? 5. Was the individual given an opportunity to improve his or her performance? 6. Has the company discharged others for similar reasons in the past? 7. Has the company acted promptly and avoided relying on "stale" offense? 8. Is the employee protected by anti-discrimination statutes? (i.e. race, age, sex, national origin, handicapped or religion)? 9. Meet with the employee personally; do not discharge by phone or letter unless absolutely necessary. 10. Have a "passive" management witness at the meeting. 11. Conduct the meeting in a private area where other employees will not be able to see or hear the discussion. 12. Both the executive and management witness should prepare file memoranda concerning what is said at the discharge meeting. 13. Always tell the employee the reason for her or his discharge. 14. Discuss health insurance continuation (COBRA). 15. Discuss life and disability insurance, and pension/profit sharing status. 16. Discuss other issues, such as references and out placement policies. By taking the time to follow these suggestions and answer these questions, an employer can feel more secure that the termination has been conducted properly, and minimize the chances of becoming implicated in legal action related to the termination.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the determinants of informal economic activity. We present two equilibrium models of informality and test their implications using a survey of 48,000+ small firms in Brazil. We define informality as tax avoidance; firms in the informal sector avoid tax payments but suffer other limitations. In the first model there is a single industry and informal firms face a higher cost of capital and a limitation on size. As a result informal firms are smaller and have a lower capital labor ratio. When education is an imperfect proxy for ability, we show that the interaction of the manager's education and formality has a positive correlation with firm size. These implications are supported by our empirical analysis. A novel theoretical contribution in this paper is a model that highlights the role of value added taxes in transmitting informality. It predicts that the informality of a firm is correlated to the informality of firms from which it buys or sells. The model also implies that higher tolerance for informal firms in one production stage increases tax avoidance in downstream and upstream sectors. Empirical analysis shows that, in fact, various measures of formality of suppliers and purchasers (and its enforcement) are correlated with the formality of a firm. Even more interestingly, when we look at sectors where Brazilian firms are not subject to the credit system of value added tax, but instead the value added tax is applied at some stage of production at a rate that is estimated by the State, this chain effect vanishes.},

Using detailed individual-level matched panel data, covering a large share of manufacturing firms and more than 30 million workers between 1997 and 2002, we consider the endogeneity of profits, by adopting different measures of profits and different instruments and by controlling for spell fixed effects. Our results, robust to different specifications and tests, indicate no evidence of rent sharing. This conclusion contrasts with findings for most developed countries, even those with flexible labour markets. Possible explanations for the lack of rent sharing include the weakness of labour-market institutions, the high levels of worker turnover and the macroeconomic instability faced by the country.},

Growth in the services sector was substantially more poverty-reducing than was growth in either agriculture or industry. Growth in industry had different effects on poverty across different states and its impact varied with initial conditions related to human development and worker empowerment. But because there was so little of it, economic growth actually played a relatively small role in accounting for Brazil's poverty reduction between 1985 and 2004.

Considerable worker flows in the formal labor market during 1997-2001 are directed toward lower income regions-the reverse flows of those often posited for informal labor markets. Estimation of the worker's multi-choice migration problem shows that previously unobserved employer covariates are significant predictors associated with migration flows. These results support the idea that globalization acts on internal migration through job stability at exporting establishments and employment opportunities at locations with a concentration of foreign owned establishments. A 1{\%} increase in exporter employment predicts a 0.3{\%} reduced probability of migration. A 1{\%} increase in the concentration of foreign owned establishments at potential destinations is associated with a 0.2{\%} increase in the migration rate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The key feature of our theoretical argument is that migrant networks evolve, accumulate, and generate higher than expected levels of internal migration to particular neighborhoods. As internal migrants become increasingly concentrated and a dynamic feedback process emerges between origin and destination, the metropolis becomes both segmented and segregated.},

abstract = {Regional and local capacity building in Brazil, as in other Latin American countries, has traditionally been linked with democracy. Whereas periods of dictatorship usually saw the establishment of a tight grip by the centre over state and local governments, democracy has been linked to greater autonomy at the regional and local levels. The revival of regional and local governments in Brazil over the last decade and a half seems to fall into this latter category. In this paper we will argue that the advent of democracy is however not the only factor behind the recent dynamism at the sub-national level, but that economic restructuring is becoming a major force behind the adoption of more pro-active attitudes and policies by local and regional governments. We will illustrate this theory with the example of the greater ABC region, in the S{\~{a}}o Paulo metropolitan area, where economic crisis and restructuring has led to inter-municipal co-operation and the creation of a local economic development council. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Only one out of seven exited poverty by migrating to the big cities, even though those moving to the city experienced on average faster consumption growth. Further analysis of a much larger cross-country panel of 51 developing countries cannot reject that rural diversification and secondary town development lead to more inclusive growth patterns than metropolitization. Indications are that this follows because more of the poor find their way to the rural nonfarm economy and secondary towns, than to distant cities. The development discourse would benefit from shifting beyond the rural–urban dichotomy and focusing more instead on how best to urbanize and develop its rural nonfarm economy and secondary towns},

Using linked employer-employee data for Brazil, we show that much of overall wage inequality arises within sector-occupations and for workers with similar observable characteristics; this within component is driven by wage dispersion between firms; and wage dispersion between firms is related to firm employment size and trade participation. We then extend the heterogenous-firm model of trade and inequality from Helpman, Itskhoki and Redding (2010) and structurally estimate it with Brazilian data. We show that the estimated model fits the data well, both in terms of key moments as well as in terms of the overall distributions of wages and employment, and find that international trade is important for this fit. In the estimated model, reductions in trade costs have a sizeable effect on wage inequality.},

This paper develops a global urban disaster risk index that evaluates the mortality and economic risks from disasters in 1,943 cities in developing countries. Concentrations of population, infrastructure, and economic activities in cities contribute to increased exposure and susceptibility to natural hazards. The three components of this risk measure are urban hazard characteristics, exposure, and vulnerability. For earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and landslides, single hazard risk indices are developed. In addition, a multi- hazard index gives a holistic picture of current city risk. Demographic-economic projection of city population growth to 2050 suggests that exposure to earthquake and cyclone risk in developing country cities will more than double from today's levels. Global urban risk analysis, as presented in this paper, can inform the prioritization of resources for disaster risk management and urban planning and promote the shift toward managing risks rather than emergencies.},

The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

To empirically disentangle alternative determinants of location choices, we use Berlin's division and reunification as a source of exogenous variation in the surrounding concentration of economic activity. Using disaggregated data on land prices, workplace employment and residence employment for thousands of city blocks for 1936, 1986 and 2006, we find that the model can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure.},

The estimates show that inequality of world distribution of income worsened from the beginning of the 19th century to World War II and after that seems to have stabilized or to have grown more slowly. In the early 19th century most inequality was due to differences within countries; later, it was due to differences between countries. Inequality in longevity, also increased during the 19th century, but then was reversed in the second half of the 20th century, perhaps mitigating the failure of income inequality to improve in the last decades.},

abstract = {It is a standard practice in regression analyses to allow for clustering in the error covariance matrix if the explanatory variable of interest varies at a more aggregate level (e.g., the state level) than the units of observation (e.g., individuals). Often, however, the structure of the error covariance matrix is more complex, with correlations not vanishing for units in different clusters. Here, we explore the implications of such correlations for the actual and estimated precision of least squares estimators. Our main theoretical result is that with equal-sized clusters, if the covariate of interest is randomly assigned at the cluster level, only accounting for nonzero covariances at the cluster level, and ignoring correlations between clusters as well as differences in within-cluster correlations, leads to valid confidence intervals. However, in the absence of random assignment of the covariates, ignoring general correlation structures may lead to biases in standard errors. We illustrate our findings ...},

Each community's network is measured by the proportion of the sampled individuals who are located at the destination (the United States) in any year. We verify that the same individual is more likely to be employed and to hold a higher paying nonagricultural job when his network is exogenously larger, by including individual fixed effects in the employment and occupation regressions and by using rainfall in the origin-community as an instrument for the size of the network at the destination.},

abstract = {This paper studies the processes of wage and employment dynamics within local labor markets. The theoretical context is a dynamic spa- tial equilibrium among locales that is supported by incentives to migrate to markets offering the greatest present value of future earnings. Thus costly migration arbitrages geographic wage differ- ences. Using a time series of cross-sectional files from the Current Population Surveys of 1977-79, I find that wages are sensitive to interarea differences in market conditions. A positive relative shock to local labor demand increases relative wages within a locale, but expectations of future demand actually reduce current wages be- cause of increased current migration. Thus wages are more flexible in response to transitory changes in local market conditions than to permanent ones. Consistent with theory, wages are most flexible among the least mobile demographic groups, who are inelastically supplied across geographic areas.},

In particular, we study the effect of Tea Party movement rallies in the United States on the movement's strength, citizen voting behavior, and voting on legislation by U.S. represen- tatives. To identify the causal effect of rallies, we use an instrumental variables approach by exploiting variation in weather on the rally day. We ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant and substan- tially important effect of the Tea Party protests. Our results show that the rallies strengthen the political movement by increasing membership and campaign contributions. We show that rallies also affect voting behavior as they increase the republican vote share in congressional elections. Policy making is also affected as a Tea Party rally in the district causes the in- cumbent representative to vote more conservative in the U.S. Congress. Finally, the estimates imply signiﬁcant multiplier effects - for every rally attendee the number of Republican votes increases by more than one. Together our results suggest that political protest build political movements that that can ultimately affect policy.},

Consciously breaking with state-centric forms of social science, it argues for a research agenda that is more adequate to the exigencies and consequences of globalization than has traditionally been the case in 'development studies'. Drawing on earlier attempts to analyse the cross-border activities of firms, their spatial configurations and developmental consequences, the article moves beyond these by proposing the framework of the 'global production network' (GPN). It explores the conceptual elements involved in this framework in some detail and then turns to sketch a stylized example of a GPN. The article concludes with a brief indication of the benefits that could be delivered by research informed by GPN analysis.},

We find evidence of both MAR externalities, which are associated with past own industry employment concentration, and Jacobs externalities, which are associated with past diversity of local total employment. More specifically, for mature capital goods industries, there is evidence of MAR externalities but none of Jacobs externalities. For new high-tech industries, there is evidence of Jacobs and MAR externalities. These findings are consistent with notions of urban specialization and product cycles: new industries prosper in large, diverse metropolitan areas, but with maturity, production decentralizes to smaller, more specialized cities. For mature industries, there is also a high degree of persistence in individual employment patterns across cities, fostered by both MAR externalities and persistence in regional comparative advantage.},

abstract = {In the face of the recent institutional breakdown of trust in business, managers are losing legitimacy. To regain public trust, management needs to become a true profession in much the way medicine and law have, argue Khurana and Nohria of Harvard Business School. True professions have codes, and the meaning and consequences of those codes are taught as part of the formal education required of their members. Through these codes, professional institutions forge an implicit social contract with society: Trust us to control and exercise jurisdiction over an important occupational category, and, in return, we will ensurethat the members of our profession are worthy of your trust--that they will not only be competent to perform the tasks entrusted to them, but that they will also conduct themselves with high standardsand great integrity. The authors believe that enforcing educational standards and a code of ethics is unlikely to choke entrepreneurial creativity. Indeed, if the field of medicine is any indication, a code may even stimulate creativity. The main challenge in writing a code lies in reaching a broad consensus on the aims and social purpose of management. There are two deeply divided schools of thought. One school argues that management's aim should simply be to maximize shareholder wealth; the other argues that management's purpose is to balance the claims of all the firm's stakeholders. Any code will have to steer a middle course in order to accommodate both the value-creating impetus of the shareholder value concept and the accountability inherent in the stakeholder approach.},

But over the twentieth century, the costs of moving these goods have declined by over 90{\%}in real terms, and there is little reason to doubt that this decline will continue. Moreover, technological change has eliminated the importance of fixed infrastructure transport (rail and water) that played a critical role in creating natural urban centres. In this article, we document this decline and explore several simple implications of a world where it is essentially free to move goods, but expensive to move people.

abstract = {Like many other assets, housing prices are quite volatile relative to observable changes in fundamentals. If we are going to understand boom-bust housing cycles, we must incorporate housing supply. In this paper, we present a simple model of housing bubbles that predicts that places with more elastic housing supply have fewer and shorter bubbles, with smaller price increases. However, the welfare consequences of bubbles may actually be higher in more elastic places because those places will overbuild more in response to a bubble. The data show that the price run-ups of the 1980s were almost exclusively experienced in cities where housing supply is more inelastic. More elastic places had slightly larger increases in building during that period. Over the past five years, a modest number of more elastic places also experienced large price booms, but as the model suggests, these booms seem to have been quite short. Prices are already moving back towards construction costs in those areas. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the role of regional cluster composition in regional industry performance. On the one hand, diminishing returns to specialization in a location can result in a convergence effect: the growth rate of an industry within a region may be declining in the level of economic activity of that industry. At the same time, positive spillovers across complementary economic activities can provide an impetus for agglomeration: the growth rate of an industry within a region may be increasing in the "strength" (i.e., relative presence) of related industries. Building on Porter (1998, 2003), we develop a systematic empirical framework to analyze the role of regional clusters - groups of closely related industries operating within a particular region - in the growth of regional industries. We exploit data from the US Cluster Mapping Project to examine the effects of agglomeration within regional clusters after controlling for convergence at the region-industry level. Our findings suggest that industries located in a strong cluster register higher employment and patenting growth. Regional industry growth also increases with the strength of related clusters in the region and with the strength of similar clusters in adjacent regions. We also find evidence of the complementarity between employment and innovation performance in regional clusters: both the initial employment and patenting strength of a cluster have a separate positive effect on the employment and patenting growth of the constituent industries. Finally, we find that new regional industries emerge where there is a strong cluster. These findings are consistent with multiple types of externalities arising in clusters, including knowledge, skills, and input-output linkages. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper argues that more rigorous evaluations of local economic development policies are feasible. Programs that aid selected small firms can be rigorously evaluated using an experimental approach, without excluding firms from assistance, by randomly assigning some firms to receive more intense marketing efforts by the program. Programs that aid distressed local areas can be rigorously evaluated by random assignment of the program among eligible distressed areas. If an experiment cannot be done, a variety of statistical approaches can be used to compare firms or areas that use the program with comparison groups of firms or areas that do not use the program. These statistical analyses should be supplemented with surveys and focus groups with businesses that use the program, which give some insight into why the program works or doesn't work. Evaluations should go beyond the effects of programs on business growth to effects on local fiscal health and the earnings of the unemployed. Evaluations using rigorous approaches suggest that programs providing information services to small manufacturers are frequently effective. Programs targeting distressed areas are ineffective unless great resources are used over a lengthy period. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {This paper examines city formation in a country whose urban population is growing steadily over time, with new cities required to accommodate this growth. In contrast to most of the literature there is immobility of housing and urban infrastructure, and investment in these assets is taken on the basis of forward-looking behavior. In the presence of these fixed assets cities form sequentially, without the population swings in existing cities that arise in current models, but with swings in house rents. Equilibrium city size, absent government, may be larger or smaller than is efficient, depending on how urban externalities vary with population. Efficient formation of cities with internalization of externalities involves local government intervention and borrowing to finance development. The paper explores the institutions required for successful local government intervention. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a joint study of the U.S. structural transformation (the decline of agriculture as the dominating sector) and regional convergence (of southern to northern average wages). We find empirically that most of the regional convergence is attributable to the structural transformation: the nationwide convergence of agricultural wages to nonagricultural wages and the faster rate of transition of the southern labor force from agricultural to nonagricultural jobs. Similar results describe the Midwest's catch‐up to the Northeast (but not the relative experience of the West). To explain these observations, we construct a model in which the South (Midwest) has a comparative advantage in producing unskilled labor–intensive agricultural goods. Thus it starts with a disproportionate share of the unskilled labor force and lower per capita incomes. Over time, declining education/training costs induce an increasing proportion of the labor force to move out of the (unskilled) agricultural sector and into the (skilled) nonagricultural sector. The decline in the agricultural labor force leads to an increase in relative agricultural wages. Both effects benefit the South (Midwest) disproportionately since it has more agricultural workers. With the addition of a less than unit income elasticity of demand for farm goods and faster technological progress in farming than outside of farming, this model successfully matches the quantitative features of the U.S. structural transformation and regional convergence, as well as several other stylized facts on U.S. economic growth in the last century. The model does not rely on frictions on interregional labor and capital mobility, since in our empirical work we find this channel to be less important than the compositional effects the model emphasizes.

There is also a negative association between local inequality and the growth of both income and population, once we control for the initial distribution of skills. What determines the degree of inequality across metropolitan areas? Twenty years ago, metropolitan inequality was strongly associated with poverty, but today, inequality is more strongly linked to the presence of the wealthy. Inequality in skills can explain about one third of the variation in income inequality, and that skill inequality is itself explained by historical schooling patterns and immigration. There are also substantial differences in the returns to skill, related to local concentrations in different industries, and these too are strongly correlated with inequality.},

This reduced-form result is robust to standard demographic controls, as well as to including aggregate measures of human capital and sectoral mix. Analysis of displaced worker surveys shows that this relationship is present in cases of involuntary separation as well. In contrast, we actually find the opposite result (higher rates of occupational and industrial switching) for the subsample of younger workers. These results provide evidence consistent with increasing-returns-to-scale matching in labor markets. Results from a back-of-the-envelope calibration suggest that this mechanism has an important role in raising both wages and returns to experience in denser areas. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The performance of regional economies varies markedly in terms of wage, wage growth, employment growth and patenting rate. Based on the distribution of economic activity across geography, we classify US industries into traded, local and resource-dependent. Traded industries account for only about one-third of employment but register much higher wages, far higher rates of innovation and influence local wages. We delineate clusters of traded industries using co-location patterns across US regions. The mix of clusters differs markedly across regions. The performance of regional economies is strongly influenced by the strength of local clusters and the vitality and plurality of innovation. Regional wage differences are dominated by the relative performance of the region in the clusters in which it has positions, with the particular mix of clusters secondary.

In this two-industry economy, a zero-profit equilibrium with symmetrically located firms may exhibit rather strange properties. First, demand curves are kinked, although firms make "Nash" conjectures. If equilibrium lies at the kink, the effects of parameter changes are perverse. In the short run, prices are rigid in the face of small cost changes. In the long run, increases in costs lower equilibrium prices. Increases in market size raise prices. The welfare properties are also perverse at a kinked equilibrium.},

These are the industrial, geographic, and temporal scope of economic agglomeration economies. In each case, the literature suggests that agglomeration economies attenuate with distance. Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all con- tribute to agglomeration.},

We use a firm-level panel containing production data together with detailed information on the geographic location of employment, covering a high proportion of the New Zealand economy. We are able to control for heterogeneity along firm, region, and industry dimensions, and to estimate separate agglomeration elasticities across industries and regions. Sorting leads to upward biased elasticity estimates but using firm fixed effects can lead to downward bias due to the highly persistent nature of agglomeration variables. Our preferred estimates control for sorting across regions and industries. Overall, we find a positive agglomeration elasticity of 0.066. Within industries and, to a lesser extent within regions, there is pronounced variation in the strength of agglomeration effects, and evidence of decreasing returns to agglomeration. High density areas attract firms that benefit most from agglomeration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Research has yet to acknowledge the possibility of limits to the financial returns of this important strategic construct. This study suggests an inverted-U shaped relationship between ACAP and financial performance. Based on data from 285 technology-based small and medium enterprises, we observe gains within three prospective, secondary measures of growth to diminish beyond lower levels of ACAP, even turning negative and becoming harmful beyond intermediate levels. We find that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) moderates the ACAPperformance relationship, enhancing financial gains at lower levels of ACAP and mitigating the decline in financial performance at higher levels of ACAP. Further, with higher EO, higher ACAP can be achieved before financial returns diminish.},

Based on a panel of quality of life and business environment measures, households prefer MSAs in warm coastal areas and non-metropolitan locations, while firms prefer large, growing cities. In addition, cities with improving business environments acquire increasing shares of workers, especially workers with high levels of human capital; cities with improving consumer amenities become relatively more populated by retirees. Further analysis of individual level migration decisions indicates that regardless of marital status, young, highly educated households tend to move towards places with higher quality business environments. This tendency is especially pronounced among highly educated couples who are more subject to job market co-location problems. In contrast, regardless of education, couples near retirement tend to move away from places with favorable business environments and towards places with highly valued consumer amenities. These patterns help explain why areas unattractive to both households and business have struggled, as with upstate New York, while the sun-belt and other regions are thriving. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Empirical research on cities starts with a spatial equilibrium condition: workers and firms are assumed to be indifferent across space. This condition implies that research on cities is different from research on countries, and that work on places within countries needs to consider population, income, and housing prices simultaneously. Housing supply elasticity will determine whether urban success reveals itself in the form of more people or higher incomes. Urban economists generally accept the existence of agglomeration economies, which exist when productivity rises with density, but estimating the magnitude of those economies is difficult. Some manufacturing firms cluster to reduce the costs of moving goods, but this force no longer appears to be important in driving urban success. Instead, modern cities are far more dependent on the role that density can play in speeding the flow of ideas. Finally, urban economics has some insights to offer related topics such as growth theory, national income accounts, public economics, and housing prices. (JEL R11, R23, R31, R32)},

abstract = {A large body of research has established a positive connection between an industry's productivity and the magnitude of its presence within locally defined geographic areas. This paper examines whether this relationship can be linked to a micro-level underpinning commonly associated with productivity: establishment scale. Looking at manufacturing industries across a sample of U.S. metropolitan areas, I find two primary results. First, average plant size increases substantially as an industry's employment in a metropolitan area rises. Second, the direct association between worker wages and local industry employment is more strongly associated with average plant size than the total number of plants, suggesting that localization economies may have significant organizational aspects. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Historically, waterborne transport of goods required portage around the falls at these points, while some falls provided water power during early industrialization. These factors attracted commerce and manufacturing. Although these original advantages have long since been made obsolete, we document the continuing importance of these portage sites over time. We interpret these results as path dependence and contrast explanations based on sunk costs interacting with decreasing versus increasing returns to scale.},

This topic is of interest because of a number of key stylized facts, including notably Zipf's law for cities (which states that the number of cities of size greater than S is proportional to 1/S) and the importance of urban primacy. We first review the empirical evidence on the upper tail of city size distribution. We offer a novel discussion of the important econometric issues in the characterization of the distribution. We then discuss the theories that have been advanced to explain the approximate constancy of the distribution across very different economic and social systems, emphasizing both barebone statistical theories and more developed economic theories. We discuss the more recent work on the determinants of urban growth and, in particular, growth regressions, economic explanations of city size distributions other than Gibrat's law, consequences of major shocks (quasi natural experiments), and the dynamics of U.S. urban evolution},

In Thailand, we show that a high concentration of enterprise in an area predicts high subsequent growth in and around that area. We also find spatially contiguous convergence of enterprise with stagnant areas left behind. Exogenous physiographic conditions are correlated with enterprise location and growth. We fit a structural, micro-founded model of occupation transitions with fine-tuned geographic capabilities to village data and replicate these salient facts. Key elements of the model include costs, credit constraints on occupation choice, and spatially varying expansion of financial service providers.},

Redoing this exercise today shows just how much progress we have made. In contrast to Kaldor's facts, which revolved around a single state variable, physical capital, our updated facts force consideration of four far more interesting variables: ideas, institutions, population, and human capital. Dynamic models have uncovered subtle interactions among these variables, generating important insights about such big questions as: Why has growth accelerated? Why are there gains from trade?

Many cost-effective methods of infectious disease prevention have limited uptake. Contributing factors include externalities from infectious disease prevention, public goods problems, liquidity constraints, and behavioral factors, such as present bias and limited attention. Across a variety of contexts, consumer use of cost-effective products for prevention and non-acute care is highly sensitive to price and convenience. Health education has a mixed record, often working in combination with incentives and functioning through increasing salience rather than delivering information. The quality of health services in many developing countries is very poor, with weak incentives for public sector health workers. Reforms that strengthen incentives show promise but institutional details matter. Programs based on this more nuanced understanding of health decision making can save millions of lives. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We show that in a two-sector economy with heterogeneous capital subsidies and monopoly power, primal and dual measures of TFP growth can diverge from each other as well as from true technology. These distortions give rise to dynamic reallocation effects that imply technology growth needs to be measured from the bottom up rather than from the top down. Using Singapore as an example, we show how incomplete data can be used to estimate aggregate and sectoral technology growth as well as reallocation effects. Our framework can reconcile divergent TFP estimates in Singapore and can resolve other empirical puzzles regarding Asian development. (JEL E22, E23, E25, O33, O41, O47)},

Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},

abstract = {Empirical research on cities starts with a spatial equilibrium condition: workers and firms are assumed to be indifferent across space. This condition implies that research on cities is different from research on countries, and that work on places within countries needs to consider population, income, and housing prices simultaneously. Housing supply elasticity will determine whether urban success reveals itself in the form of more people or higher incomes. Urban economists generally accept the existence of agglomeration economies, which exist when productivity rises with density, but estimating the magnitude of those economies is difficult. Some manufacturing firms cluster to reduce the costs of moving goods, but this force no longer appears to be important in driving urban success. Instead, modern cities are far more dependent on the role that density can play in speeding the flow of ideas. Finally, urban economics has some insights to offer related topics such as growth theory, national income accounts, public economics, and housing prices. (JEL R11, R23, R31, R32)},

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

We attribute polarization to the interaction between consumer preferences, which favor variety over specialization, and the falling cost of automating routine, codifiable job tasks. Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we derive, test, and confirm four implications of this hy- pothesis. Local labor markets that were specialized in routine activities differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low skill labor into service occupations (employment polar- ization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor.

abstract = {Although economic theory predicts an inverse relation between relative wages and immigration-induced supply shifts, it has been difficult to document such effects. The weak evidence may be partly due to sampling error in a commonly used measure of the supply shift, the immigrant share of the workforce. After controlling for permanent factors that determine wages in specific labor markets, little variation remains in the immigrant share. We find significant sampling error in this measure of supply shifts in Canadian and U.S. census data. Correcting for the resulting attenuation bias can substantially increase existing estimates of the wage impact of immigration. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {Does switching the composition of jobs between low-paying and high-paying industries have important effects on wages in other sectors? In this paper, we build on search and bargaining theory to clarify a key general equilibrium channel through which changes in industrial composition could have substantial effects on wages in all sectors. In this class of models, wage determination takes the form of a social interaction problem and we illustrate how the implied sectoral linkages can be empirically explored using U.S. Census data. We find that sector-level wages interact as implied by the model and that the predicted general equilibrium effects are present and substantial. We interpret our results as highlighting the relevance of search and bargaining theory for understanding the determination of wages, and we argue that the results provide support for the view that industrial composition is important for understanding wage outcomes.},

In Thailand, we show that a high concentration of enterprise in an area predicts high subsequent growth in and around that area.

We fit a structural, micro-founded model of occupation transitions with fine-tuned geographic capabilities to village data and replicate these salient facts. Key elements of the model include costs, credit constraints on occupation choice, and spatially varying expansion of financial service providers.},

abstract = {The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and longevity.},

abstract = {Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 {\textgreater}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 {\textless}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta{\textless}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

We find that large cities are more skilled than are small cities, but only to a modest degree. We also show that the increase in productivity associated with agglomeration, as measured by the urban wage premium, is larger for workers with stronger cognitive and people skills. In contrast, motor skills and physical strength are not rewarded to a greater degree in large cities. Urbanization thus enhances thinking and social interaction, rather than physical abilities. These results are robust to a variety of estimation strategies, including using NLSY variables that control for worker quality and a worker-MSA fixed effect specification. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Since the data allow us to track the same workers over the years, we are in the unusual position of obtaining the individual wages before and after the migration process. As a significant share of workers changed States in the sample period, it is possible to examine to what extent the wage differentials reflect the concentration of high-skilled individuals in some States. The results showthat the overallwage variability across States drops to almost one third of its original value and the ranking of the State effects is significantly altered after we take into account the workers' fixed effects. A great deal of the inter-regional differentials, therefore, reflects differences in the average ability of workers across States.},

abstract = {Growing interest in inequality has generated an outpouring of scholarly research and has brought many discussions on the subject into the public realm. Surprisingly, most of these studies and discussions rely on a narrow set of indicators to measure inequality. Most of the time a single summary measure of inequality is considered: the Gini coefficient. This is surprising not only because there are many ways to measure inequality, but mostly because the Gini coefficient has only limited success in its ability to generate the amount and type of data required to analyze the complex patterns and dynamics of inequality within and across countries. Often, in defense of the use of the Gini coefficient, it is argued that this popular indicator has a readily intuitive interpretation. While from a formal point of view most measures of inequality are closely interrelated, at an intuitive level this interrelationship is rarely highlighted. This paper suggests an intuitive interpretation for the Theil index, a measure of inequality with unique properties that makes it a powerful instrument to produce data and to analyze patterns and dynamics of inequality. Since the potential of the Theil index to generate rich data sets has been analyzed elsewhere (Concei{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o and Galbraith, 1998), here we will focus on the intuitive interpretation of the Theil index and on its potential for analytical work. The discussion will be accompanied throughout with empirical applications, and concludes with the description of a simple software application that can be used to compute the Theil index at different levels of aggregation of the individuals that compose the distribution},

abstract = {This paper proposes a unified theoretical framework where formal and informal firms coexist and face the same type of product and labor market imperfections: they have monopoly power in the goods market, they are subject to matching frictions in the labor market, and wages are determined by bargaining between large firms and their workers, through either individual or collective bargaining. Our model matches the main stylized facts on informality for developing countries and appears to be a good candidate for policy analysis. In this framework, we study the impact on informality, wages and unemployment of policies that may be used to reduce informality. We consider changes in product market regulation (PMR) and in two types of fiscal policies, labor taxes and formality enforcement. We find that lessening PMR decreases informality and unemployment simultaneously, indicating that there is not necessarily a tradeoff between informality and unemployment. The tradeoff appears when fiscal policies are used, though. Moreover, the impacts of PMR on unemployment and on wages are larger under collective than individual bargaining. With respect to wage inequality, lessening PMR reduces it, while lower taxes tend to increase the formal sector wage premium.},

abstract = {This paper develops a two-sector matching model that incorporates the main features of Latin American labor markets. It has an innovation in its matching structure that makes it more consistent with some key stylized facts of the informal sector in these countries. The model is numerically solved using Brazilian data and several policy simulations are performed. Reducing formal sector's entry cost significantly reduces the size of the informal sector and improves overall labor market performance. Increasing enforcement significantly reduces informality but has strong adverse effects on unemployment and welfare. Thus, the results indicate that the tradeoff between lower informal employment and higher unemployment rates is not present when one looks at policies that aim at reducing the costs of being formal, as opposed to policies that simply increase the costs of being informal. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The expansion of urban slums is a key challenge for public and social policy in the 21st century. The heterogeneous and dynamic nature of slum communities limits the use of rigid slum definitions. A systematic and flexible approach to characterize, delineate and model urban slum structure at an operational resolution is essential to plan, deploy, and monitor interventions at the local and national level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We modeled the multi-dimensional structure of urban slums in the city of Salvador, a city of 3 million inhabitants in Brazil, by integrating census-derived socioeconomic variables and remotely-sensed land cover variables. We assessed the correlation between the two sets of variables using canonical correlation analysis, identified land cover proxies for the socioeconomic variables, and produced an integrated map of deprivation in Salvador at 30 m × 30 m resolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The canonical analysis identified three significant ordination axes that described the structure of Salvador census tracts according to land cover and socioeconomic features. The first canonical axis captured a gradient from crowded, low-income communities with corrugated roof housing to higher-income communities. The second canonical axis discriminated among socioeconomic variables characterizing the most marginalized census tracts, those without access to sanitation or piped water. The third canonical axis accounted for the least amount of variation, but discriminated between high-income areas with white-painted or tiled roofs from lower-income areas.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our approach captures the socioeconomic and land cover heterogeneity within and between slum settlements and identifies the most marginalized communities in a large, complex urban setting. These findings indicate that changes in the canonical scores for slum areas can be used to track their evolution and to monitor the impact of development programs such as slum upgrading.},

Among these techniques, Propensity-Score Matching (PSM) is increasingly applied in the policy evaluation community. This technical note provides a guide to the key aspects of implementing PSM methodology for an audience of practitioners interested in understanding its applicability to specific evaluation problems. The note summarizes the basic conditions under which PSM can be used to estimate the impact of a program and the data required. It explains how the Conditional Independence Assumption, combined with the Overlap Condition, reduces selection bias when participation in a program is determined by observable characteristics. It also describes different matching algorithms and some tests to assess the quality of the matching. Case studies are used throughout to illustrate important concepts in impact evaluation and PSM.

abstract = {Spatial econometrics has been criticized by some economists because some model specifications have been driven by data-analytic considerations rather than having a firm foundation in economic theory. In particular this applies to the so-called W matrix, which is integral to the structure of endogenous and exogenous spatial lags, and to spatial error processes, and which are almost the sine qua non of spatial econometrics. Moreover it has been suggested that the significance of a spatially lagged dependent variable involving W may be misleading, since it may be simply picking up the effects of omitted spatially dependent variables, incorrectly suggesting the existence of a spillover mechanism. In this paper we review the theoretical and empirical rationale for network dependence and spatial externalities as embodied in spatially lagged variables, arguing that failing to acknowledge their presence at least leads to biased inference, can be a cause of inconsistent estimation, and leads to an incorrect understanding of true causal processes.},

abstract = {Matching methods for causal inference have become a popular way of reducing model dependence and bias, in large part because of their convenience and conceptual simplicity. Researchers most commonly use matching as a data preprocessing step, after which they apply whatever statistical model and uncertainty estimators they would have without matching. Unfortunately, for a given sample of any finite size, this approach is theoretically appropriate only under exact matching, which is usually infeasible; approximate matching can be justified under asymptotic theory, if large enough sample sizes are available, but then specialized point and variance estimators are required, which sacrifices some of matching's simplicity and convenience. Researchers also violate statistical theory with ad hoc iterations between formal matching methods and informal balance checks. Instead of asking researchers to change their widely used practices, we develop a comprehensive theory of statistical inference able to justify them. The theory we propose is substantively plausible, requires no asymptotic theory, and is simple to understand. Its core conceptualizes continuous variables as having natural breakpoints, which are common in applications (e.g., high school or college degrees in years of education, a governmental poverty level in income, or phase transitions in temperature). The theory allows binary, multicategory, and continuous treatment variables from the outset and straightforward extensions for imperfect treatment assignment and different versions of treatments. Although this theory provides a valid foundation for most commonly used methods of matching, researchers must still satisfy the assumptions in any real application.},

It can also estimate stratified versions of Somers' D, restricted to pairs in the same stratum. Therefore, it is possible to define strata by grouping values of a confounder, or of a propensity score based on multiple confounders, and to estimate versions of Somers' D that measure the association between the outcome and the predictor, adjusted for the confounders. The Stata 9 version of somersd uses the Mata language for improved computational efficiency with large datasets.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the cyclical properties of worker flows in Brazil and Mexico, two important developing countries with large unregulated or “informal” sectors. It generates three stylized facts that are critical to the accurate modeling of the sector and which suggest the need to rethink the approaches to date. First, the unemployment rate is countercyclical essentially because job separations of informal workers increase dramatically in recessions. Second, the share of formal employment is countercyclical because of the difficulty of finding formal jobs from inactivity, unemployment and other informal jobs during recessions rather than because of increased separation from formal jobs. Third, flows from formality into informality are not countercyclical, but, if anything, pro-cyclical. Together, these challenge the conventional wisdom that has guided the modeling the sector that informal workers are primarily those rationed out of the formal labor market. They also offer a new synthesis of the mechanics of the cyclical adjustment process. Finally, the paper offers estimates of the moments of worker flows series that are needed for calibration.},

The authors use two distinct but complementary lenses: informality driven by exclusion from state benefits or the circuits of the modern economy, and driven by voluntary 'exit' decisions resulting from private cost-benefit calculations that lead workers and firms to opt out of formal institutions. They find both lenses have considerable explanatory power to understand the causes and consequences of informality in the region. Informality: exit and exclusion concludes that reducing informality levels and overcoming the 'culture of informality' will require actions to increase aggregate productivity in the economy, reform poorly designed regulations and social policies, and increase the legitimacy of the state by improving the quality and fairness of state institutions and policies.

@article{LaPorta2014,
abstract = {I n developing countries, informal firms account for up to half of economic activity. They provide livelihood for billions of people. Yet their role in economic development remains controversial. Some, like Hernando De Soto (1989, 2000), see informal firms as an untapped reservoir of entrepreneurial energy, held back by government regulations. In this view, unleashing this energy by reducing entry regulations or improving prop-erty rights would fuel growth and development. Others, like Levy (2008), take a more cynical view, stressing the advantages enjoyed by informal firms and workers from avoiding taxes and regulations. A report from the McKinsey Global Institute describes informal firms as parasites competing unfairly with law-abiding formal firms (Farrell 2004). In this view, informality should be suppressed, not unleashed. Still others follow the development tradition of Lewis (1954), Harris and Todaro (1970), and more recently Rauch (1991) and see informality as a byproduct of poverty. From this dual perspective, formal and informal firms are fundamentally different. Productive formal entrepreneurs pay taxes and bear the cost of govern-ment regulation to reach new customers, raise capital, and access public goods. These entrepreneurs are often educated and find it more profitable to run bigger formal firms rather than the smaller informal ones. In contrast, informal entrepre-neurs are typically uneducated and unproductive, and they run small businesses producing low-quality products for low-income customers using little capital and adding little value. Informal firms do not threaten formal firms, and the increase in firm value that the informal entrepreneurs or managers could realize by operating formally is too small to offset the additional costs from taxes and regulations. In this dual view, development comes from formal firms, and their expansion as the economy modernizes eventually dooms the informal economy. In this paper, we assess these perspectives. To begin, we establish five critical facts about the informal economy. First, it is huge, especially in developing coun-tries. Second, it has extremely low productivity compared to the formal economy: informal firms are typically small, inefficient, and run by poorly educated entrepre-neurs. Third, although avoidance of taxes and regulations is an important reason for informality, the productivity of informal firms is too low for them to thrive in the formal sector. Lowering registration costs neither brings many informal firms into the formal sector, nor unleashes economic growth. Fourth, the informal economy is largely disconnected from the formal economy. Informal firms rarely transi-tion to formality, and continue their existence, often for years or even decades, without much growth or improvement. Fifth, as countries grow and develop, the informal economy eventually shrinks, and the formal economy comes to dominate economic life. We argue that the evidence is most consistent with dual models of informality. We first review these models and stress the supply and demand factors that keep informal and formal economies separate. We then address the critical question of how the informal economy shrinks. In dual models, economic growth comes from the formal sector: that is, from firms run by educated entrepreneurs and exhibiting much higher levels of productivity. The expansion of the formal sector leads to the decline of the informal sector in relative and eventually absolute terms, although informal employment can remain high for a long time, especially when labor force growth is high. A few informal firms convert to formality, but more generally they disappear because they cannot compete with the much more-productive formal firms. Our evidence is not particularly supportive of either De Soto's romantic view of informality as pent-up potential, nor of the McKinsey view that informality is a parasitic organizational form that hinders economic growth. The dual view of infor-mality seems most consistent with the data.},

Housing 'policies' since the 1990s - as proposed by Fernando Collor de Mello, Itamar Franco, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luis??In??cio Lula da Silva's governments (in the latter case, despite much progress towards subsidized investment programs) - have sought to consolidate financial instruments in line with global markets, restructuring the way private interests operate within the system, a necessary however incomplete course of action. Different from rhetoric, this has resulted in failure as the more fundamental social results for the poor have not yet been achieved. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Wages are characterized by compensating differentials. We show that tightening enforcement does not increase unemployment and increases wages, total output, and welfare by enabling better allocation of workers to higher productivity jobs and improving competition in the formal labor market.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Is the spatial concentration of manufacturing activity able to enhance firm-level productivity? This question is particularly relevant to production in China, which has a huge territory and population, but a skewed distribution in terms of urban-rural development. This paper aims to examine the dynamics of industrial agglomeration and the impact of agglomeration on firm-level productivity in China's textile industry by using a firm-level panel dataset from 2000 to 2005. First, the average value of the Ellison-Glaeser (EG) index (city level) is found to be approximately 0.00019. Moreover, the calculated city EG index of spatial concentration for each year exhibits a decreasing trend of spatial agglomeration for garments and other fiber products, but an increasing trend for the textile industries' agglomeration in China. The above findings are similar to the findings of Lu and Tao (2009). Secondly and importantly, this study finds an inverted U-shape relationship between agglomeration and productivity. It suggests that while industrial agglomeration enhances firms' productivity, agglomeration diseconomies may appear if the degree of agglomeration is too high. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

To test some basic qualitative properties of this literature, we develop a theoretical and empirical framework in the context of European professional soccer where (incumbent) teams and players sign binding contracts which are, however, frequently renegotiated when other teams (entrants) want to hire the player. Because they weaken entrants in renegotiations, long-term contracts are useful rent-seeking devices for the contracting parties. However, they also lead to allocative distortions in the form of deterring efficient transfers. Since incumbent teams tend to benefit more from long-term contracts in renegotiations than players do, these must be compensated ex ante by higher wages when agreeing to a long-term contract. Using data from the German {\^{a}}€{\oe}Bundesliga", our model predictions are broadly confirmed.},

The econometric analysis shows that industrial agglomeration, as a share of the national output, contributes to TFP growth through frontier technology and technical efficiency; industrial agglomeration, as a share of the local economy, enhances technical efficiency but is not conducive to technological progress. Spatial density of urban employment negatively affects the growth of technical efficiency and TFP. Overall, the differences in agglomeration economies explain more than one-half of the differences in TFP growth across China's cities. The results are stable in three sub-periods. Important policy implications are derived from the empirical findings. Smaller cities should develop an industrial base that passes a critical mass. Larger cities should continue to direct new development and relocate existing firms to planned, less congested industrial districts.

To deter low-income migrants, localities in developing countries withhold public services to the informal housing sector. Using a large sample of Brazilian localities, we examine migration and exclusion, focusing on the public provision of water to small houses where low-income migrants are likely to live. Withholding water connections reduces the locality growth rate, particularly of low-education households. In terms of service provision, during dictatorship in Brazil, we find evidence of strategic exclusion, where localities appear to withhold services to deter in-migration. We also find evidence of strategic interactions among localities within metro areas in their setting of service levels: if one locality provides more services to migrant households, other localities respond by withholding service. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

While the historical data on happiness are limited, the available facts suggest that cities that are now declining were also unhappy in their more prosperous past.

In this view, subjective well-being is better viewed as one of many arguments of the utility function, rather than the utility function itself, and individuals make trade-offs among competing objectives, including but not limited to happiness.},

The study holds constant the definition of the dependent variable, the set of control variables, the sample definition, and the estimation method for all the surveys in the sample.

We find a significant positive treatment effect of education for the first generation of students, as well as their descendants: they have higher living standards, are less likely to be farmers, and are more likely to be politically active. We find large village-level externalities—descendants of the uneducated in villages with schools do better than those in control vil- lages.

abstract = {G laeser E. L., P onzetto G. A. M. and T obio K. Cities, skills and regional change, Regional Studies . One approach to urban areas emphasizes the existence of certain immutable relationships, such as Zipf's or Gibrat's law. An alternative view is that urban change reflects individual responses to changing tastes or technologies. This paper examines almost 200 years of regional change in the United States and finds that few, if any, growth relationships remain constant, including Gibrat's law. Education does a reasonable job of explaining urban resilience in recent decades, but it does not seem to predict county growth a century ago. After reviewing this evidence, a simple model of regional change is presented and estimated, where education increases the level of entrepreneurship. Human capital spillovers occur at the city level because skilled workers produce more product varieties and thereby increase labour demand. It is found that skills are associated with growth in productivity or entrepreneurship, not with growth in quality of life, at least outside of the West. It is also found that skills seem to have depressed housing supply growth in the West, but not in other regions, which supports the view that educated residents in that region have fought for tougher land-use controls. Evidence is also presented that skills have had a disproportionately large impact on unemployment during the current recession.},

abstract = {This paper documents the allocation of skills across cities and estimates the impact of agglomeration on the hedonic prices of worker skills. We find that large cities are more skilled than are small cities, but only to a modest degree. We also show that the increase in productivity associated with agglomeration, as measured by the urban wage premium, is larger for workers with stronger cognitive and people skills. In contrast, motor skills and physical strength are not rewarded to a greater degree in large cities. Urbanization thus enhances thinking and social interaction, rather than physical abilities. These results are robust to a variety of estimation strategies, including using NLSY variables that control for worker quality and a worker-MSA fixed effect specification. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We confirm that on average, workers in denser areas are more skilled. There is also strong over-representation of workers with particularly high and low skills in denser areas. These features are consistent with patterns of migration including negative selection of migrants to less dense areas and positive selection towards denser areas. Nonetheless migration, even in the long-run, accounts for little of the skill differences between denser and less dense areas. Finally, we find marked differences across age groups and some suggestions that much of the skill differences across areas can be explained by differences between occupational groups rather than within.},

This paper reviews and presents the latest estimates and patterns as found in the literature at the turn of the century.

abstract = {This paper surveys the recent literature on the causal relationship between education and earnings. I focus on four areas of work: theoretical and econometric advances in modelling the causal effect of education in the presence of heterogeneous returns to schooling; recent studies that use institutional aspects of the education system to form instrnmental variables estimates of the return to schooling; recent studies of the earnings and schooling of twins; and recent attempts to explicitly model sources of heterogeneity in the returns to education. Consistent with earlier surveys of the literature, I conclude that the average (or average marginal) return to education is not much below the estimate that emerges from a standard human capital earnings function fit by OLS. Evidence from the latest studies of identical twins suggests a small upward "ability" bias - on the order of 10{\%}. A consistent finding among studies using instrnmental variables based on institutional changes in the education system is that the estimated returns to schooling are 20-40{\%} above the corresponding OLS esti- mates. Part of the explanation for this finding may be that marginal returns to schooling for certain subgroups - particularly relatively disadvantaged groups with low education outcomes - are higher than the average marginal returns to education in the population as a whole.},

abstract = {• Why is productivity higher in cities? • Does urbanization cause growth or does growth cause urbanization? • Do countries achieve rapid growth or high incomes without urbanization? • How can policy makers reap the benefi ts of urbanization without paying too high a cost? • Does supporting urbanization imply neglecting rural areas? • Why do so few governments welcome urbanization? • What should governments do to improve housing conditions in cities as they urbanize? • Are innovations in housing fi nance a blessing or a curse for developing countries? • How will governments fi nance the trillions of dollars of infrastruc- ture spending needed for cities in developing countries? First in a series of thematic volumes, this book was prepared for the Commission on Growth and Development to evaluate the state of knowledge of the relationship between urbanization and economic growth. It does not pretend to provide all the answers, but it does iden- tify insights and policy levers to help countries make urbanization work as part of a national growth strategy. It examines a variety of topics: the relevance and policy implications of recent advances in urban econom- ics for developing countries, the role of economic geography in global economic trends and trade patterns, the impacts of urbanization on spa- tial inequality within countries, and alternative approaches to fi nancing the substantial infrastructure investments required in developing-coun- try cities. Written by prominent academics in their fi elds, Urbanization and Growth seeks to create a better understanding of the role of urbanization in growth and to inform policy makers tackling the formidable chal- lenges it poses.},

We use microdata extracted from the World Values Survey for five countries, emphasizing the Brazilian case. Our findings suggest that there is a positive and significant correlation between happiness and income. Unemployment seems to have an even higher impact, arising as a large source of unhappiness. Other variables, such as age, gender, education and marital status are controlled for. In most cases, happiness appears to be positively correlated to being married. Moreover, happiness is apparently U-shaped in age (minimizing at 50's).},

abstract = {This paper develops a two-sector matching model that incorporates the main features of Latin American labor markets. It has an innovation in its matching structure that makes it more consistent with some key stylized facts of the informal sector in these countries. The model is numerically solved using Brazilian data and several policy simulations are performed. Reducing formal sector's entry cost significantly reduces the size of the informal sector and improves overall labor market performance. Increasing enforcement significantly reduces informality but has strong adverse effects on unemployment and welfare. Thus, the results indicate that the tradeoff between lower informal employment and higher unemployment rates is not present when one looks at policies that aim at reducing the costs of being formal, as opposed to policies that simply increase the costs of being informal. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Soares2004,
abstract = {Two facts have characterized the evolution of the informal sector in Brazil during the last two decades: the increase in the proportion of non-registered workers and the diminishing wage gap between non-registered and registered workers. In this paper, we briefly review the literature on informal sector in developing countries and document both the increase of the informal sector and the fall in the wage gap in Brazil. Besides, we investigate which factors were responsible for the fall in the wage gap and how this reduction has contributed to reduce wage inequality between 1981 and 1999. Among our findings, we would highlight: i) the coincidence between these two movements and the market-oriented reforms of the early 1990's; ii) that the fall in the formal/informal wage gap has substantially contributed to the decrease in wage inequality. After education, the fall in the wage premium due to the possession of a work-card was the main responsible for bringing down wage inequality. Why and how it happened is an open debate. We will tackle this issue on two forthcoming papers were we investigate the role of the trade liberalization (Soares, 2004a) and the effects of the increasing indexation of informal sector wages to the minimum wage (Soares, 2004b).},

Our theory generates two key empirically verified predictions: (i) males in relatively wealthy households within a caste who benefit less from the redistributive (surplus-maximizing) network will be more likely to migrate, and (ii) males in households facing greater rural income risk (who benefit more from the insurance network) migrate less. Structural estimates show that small improvements in formal insurance decrease the spatial misallocation of labor by substantially increasing migration.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {This study examines the determinants of rural-urban migration paying special attention to the role of human capital externalities in the rural sector. Using data from a well-known household survey in China, we find that in rural areas human capital externalities have a discouraging effect on rural-urban migration-everything else being the same, a rural resident from a county rich in human capital is less likely to migrate to the city than his counterpart from another county poor in human capital endowment. We also find some evidence that human capital exerts positive external effects on the likelihood for a rural resident to choose off-farm employment and on labor income in the rural sector. These results are robust to alternative model specifications and estimation methods. One important policy implication from this study is that expanding education opportunities in rural areas can help curtail rural-urban migration and therefore alleviate urban unemployment pressure. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Though the determinants of regional economic growth in China have been widely discussed in previous studies, the effects of knowledge capital and spillover have been less systematically investigated. This paper assesses how and to what extent knowledge capital and technology spillover contribute to regional economic growth in China. Moreover, the absorptive ability played by human capital on acquiring advanced foreign technologies is also investigated in this study. Empirical results show that knowledge capital, both of R{\&}D capital and technology imports contribute significantly, with similar impact, to regional economic growth. The analyses also suggest the existence of R{\&}D spillovers as well as international knowledge spillovers. Moreover, a region's absorptive ability is considered as the critical capability to absorb external knowledge sources embodied in FDI and imports, which then contribute to the regional economic growth.},

abstract = {This paper is among the first to link the literatures on migration and on subjective well-being in developing countries. It poses the question: why do rural-urban migrant households settled in urban China have an average happiness score lower than rural households? Three basic hypotheses are examined: migrants had false expectations about their future urban conditions, or about their future urban aspirations, or about their future selves. Estimated happiness functions and decomposition analyses, based on a 2002 national household survey, indicate that certain features of migrant conditions make for unhappiness, and that their high aspirations in relation to achievement, influenced by their new reference groups, also make for unhappiness. Although the possibility of selection bias among migrants cannot be ruled out, it is apparently difficult for migrants to form unbiased expectations about life in a new and different world. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {July 2001 Both productivity growth and factor accumulation figured significantly in China's remarkable growth performance between 1978 and 1999, a period of reform. Considering China's need for an innovation-based knowledge economy, the recent declining rate of human capital accumulation--education--is a cause for concern. China's performance in economic growth and poverty reduction has been remarkable. There is an ongoing debate about whether this growth is mainly driven by productivity or factor accumulation. But few past studies had incorporated information on China's human capital stock, and thus contained an omission bias. Wang and Yao construct a measure of China's human capital stock from 1952 to 1999 and, using a simple growth accounting exercise, incorporate it in their analysis of the sources of growth during the pre-reform (1952-77) and the reform period (1978-99). They find that the accumulation of human capital in China (as measured by the average years of schooling for the population aged 15 to 64) was quite rapid and contributed significantly to growth and welfare. After incorporating human capital, they also find that the growth of total factor productivity still plays a positive and significant role during the reform period. In contrast, productivity growth was negative in the pre-reform period. The results are robust to changes in labor shares in GDP. The recent declining rate of human capital accumulation is a cause for concern, if China is to sustain its improvements in growth and welfare in the coming decade. Funding for basic education is unevenly distributed and insufficient in some poor regions. This paper--a product of the Economic Policy and Poverty Reduction Division, World Bank Institute--is part of a larger effort in the institute to examine country experience on globalization and growth.

We project that, in the near term, overall regional inequality as measured by the coefficient of variation is likely to decline modestly but that the coast/noncoast income differential is likely to increase somewhat.

Two-stage least squares estimates indicate that a one-year increase in city average education could increase individual earnings by between 11 and 13{\%}.

abstract = {There was substantial spatial variation in labor market outcomes in Brazil over the 1990's. In 2000, about one-fifth of workers lived in apparently economically stagnant municipios where real wages declined but employment increased faster than the national population growth rate. More than one-third lived in apparently dynamic municipios experiencing both real wage growth and faster-than-average employment growth; these areas absorbed more than half of net employment growth over the period. To elucidate this spatial variation, we estimated spatial labor supply and demand equations describing wage and employment changes of Brazilian munic{\'{i}}pios. We used Conley's spatial GMM technique to allow for instrumental variable estimation in the presence of spatially autocorrelated errors. Chief findings include: a very strong influence of initial workforce educational levels on subsequent wage growth (controlling for possibly confounding variables such as remoteness and climate); evidence of positive spillover effects of ownmunicipio growth onto neighbors' wage and employment levels; an exodus from farming areas; relatively elastic response of wages to an increase in labor supply; and evidence of a local multiplier effect from government transfers.},

At the same time, the proportion of workers with a college degree has been stabilized since the early 80´s and the college wage premium is growing for workers of all ages. The present study searches for a causal relationship between the evolution of the wage gaps and the relative supply of labor. The theoretical model uses a production function that depends only on labor. The estimation follows a two stages process. At the first one, an elasticity of substitution between age groups is obtained. At the second stage, the same elasticity is obtained but it is also found an elasticity of substitution between school groups. The estimates of the elasticity of substitution between age groups at the first stage of the process were so high, that they were considered infinite. Even controlling the relative supplies by age effects, the estimates did not change. Following a procedure like Katz {\&} Murphy (1992), elasticities of substitution between school groups of approximately 1,5 were found.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Using two measures of convergence, $\sigma$-convergence and {\ss}-convergence, we examine whether per capita incomes in the states have been converging or diverging. By both standards of convergence, India demonstrated overall divergence during 1980–;98, as well as during both the pre-reform and post-reform subperiods. Interestingly, the richer states experienced a degree of convergence during the post-reform period, whereas the poorer states did not. Divergence was most notable within the poorer group of states. A remarkable 82 percent of the cross-state variation in growth is explained by just the urbanization variable in India, with no hint of any conditional convergence after controlling for the degree of urbanization. The regression estimate shows that a 10 percentage point higher rate of urbanization is associated with 1.3 percentage points per year higher rate of annual growth.},

abstract = {The world over, infrastructure mega projects have become more prevalent, even as evidence suggests that such projects often experience significant cost overruns while failing to fully deliver on their projected benefits. In this light, this article will argue that continued support for infrastructure mega projects stems from the way that such projects are presented to the public. Using the case of the development of a metro railway in Delhi, India, it shows that galvanizing public support and attracting patrons to a public transit system stems from creating an all-round positive image that combines tangible variables with an intangible set of symbolic meanings. Of course, image is only an impression, and does not necessarily reflect reality. In this light, the final section of this article examines the broad physical and societal implications of the metro development in Delhi, and uncovers the driving forces behind the project. The article concludes that, in spite of the cultivation of a positive image, the specific metro form that was developed in Delhi to satisfy each of the special interest groups involved in its production might be specifically one that fails to suit the transportation needs of the city.},

This paper endeavors to illuminate on the process of urbanization in India over a century with emphasis on level, tempo of urbanization and urban morphology using Indian Census data during 1901-2001. It will try to trace urban problems and related policy issues. At the moment, India is among the countries of low level of urbanization. Number of urban agglomeration /town has grown from 1827 in 1901 to 5161 in 2001. Number of population residing in urban areas has increased from 2.58 crores in 1901 to 28.53 crores in 2001. Only 28{\%} of population was living in urban areas as per 2001 census. Over the years there has been continuous concentration of population in class I towns. On the contrary the concentration of population in medium and small towns either fluctuated or declined. The graduation of number of urban centers from lower population size categories to class I cities has resulted top heavy structure of urban population in India. India's urbanization is often termed as over- urbanisation, pseudo- urbanization. The big cities attained inordinately large population size leading to virtual collapse in the urban services and followed by basic problems in the field of housing, slum, water, infrastructure, quality of life etc. Urbanisation is a product of demographic explosion and poverty induced rural-urban migration. Urbanisation is occurring not due to urban pull but due to rural push. Globalisation, liberalization, privatization are addressing negative process for urbanization in India. Policy relates to proper urban planning where city planning will consist of operational, developmental and restorative planning. Redirection of investment is recommended to develop strong economic base for small and medium city neglected so far so that migration flows are redirected to small and medium cities.},

abstract = {Previous studies of DMSP-OLS stable night lights have shown encouraging agreement between temporally stable lighted areas and various definitions of urban extent. However, these studies have also highlighted an inconsistent relationship between the actual lighted area and the boundaries of the urban areas considered. Applying detection frequency thresholds can reduce the spatial overextent of lighted area ("blooming") but thresholding also attenuates large numbers of smaller lights and significantly reduces the information content of the night lights datasets. Spatial analysis of the widely used 1994/1995 stable lights data and the newly released 1992/1993 and 2000 stable lights datasets quantifies the tradeoff between blooming and attenuation of smaller lights. For the 1992/1993 and 2000 datasets, a 14{\%} detection threshold significantly reduces blooming around large settlements without attenuating many individual small settlements. The corresponding threshold for the 1994/1995 dataset is 10{\%}. The size-frequency distributions of each dataset retain consistent shapes for increasing thresholds while the size-area distributions suggest a quasi-uniform distribution of lighted area with individual settlement size between 10 and 1000 km equivalent diameter. Conurbations larger than 80 km diameter account for {\textless} 1{\%} of all settlements observed but account for about half the total lighted area worldwide. Area/perimeter distributions indicate that conurbations become increasingly dendritic as they grow larger. Comparison of lighted area with built area estimates from Landsat imagery of 17 cities shows that lighted areas are consistently larger than even maximum estimates of built areas for almost all cities in every light dataset. Thresholds {\textgreater} 90{\%} can often reconcile lighted area with built area in the 1994/1995 dataset but there is not one threshold that works for a majority of the 17 cities considered. Even 100{\%} thresholds significantly overestimate built area for the 1992/1993 and 2000 datasets. Comparison of lighted area with blooming extent for 10 lighted islands suggests a linear proportionality of 1.25 of lighted to built diameter and an additive bias of 2.7 km. While more extensive analyses are needed, a linear relationship would be consistent with a physical model for atmospheric scattering combined with a random geolocation error. A Gaussian detection probability model is consistent with an observed sigmoid decrease of detection frequency for settlements {\textless} 10 km diameter. Taken together, these observations could provide the basis for a scale-dependent blooming correction procedure that simultaneously reduces geolocation error and scattering induced blooming.},

abstract = {Urbanization is arguably the most dramatic form of irreversible land transformation. Though urbanization is a worldwide phenomenon, it is especially prevalent in India, where urban areas have experienced an unprecedented rate of growth over the last 30 years. In this uncontrolled situation, city planners lack tools to measure, monitor, and understand urban sprawl processes. Multitemporal remote sensing has become an important data-gathering tool for analysing these changes. By using time-series of Landsat data, we classify urban footprints since the 1970s. This lets us detect temporal and spatial urban sprawl, redensification and urban development in the tremendously growing 12 largest Indian urban agglomerations. A multi-scale analysis aims to identify spatiotemporal urban types. At city level, the combination of absolute parameters (e.g. areal growth or built-up density) and landscape metrics (e.g. SHAPE index) quantitatively characterise the spatial pattern of the cities. Spider charts can display the spatial urban types at three time stages, showing temporal development and helping the reader compare all cities based on normalized scales. In addition, gradient analysis provides insight into location-based spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization. Therefore, we analyse zones defining the urban core versus the urban edges. The study aims to detect similarities and differences in spatial growth in the large Indian urban agglomerations. These cities in the same cultural area range from 2.5 million inhabitants to 20 million (in the metropolitan region of Mumbai). The results paint a characteristic picture of spatial pattern, gradients and landscape metrics, and thus illustrate spatial growth and future modelling of urban development in India. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The urban size is an important attribute influencing urban population growth. The small and intermediate towns are expected to grow slowly compared to large cities in the early phases of urbanisation. In the latter phase small towns are expected to grow as a result of congestion and crowding in the large and intermediate towns. The study of urban growth by size class of towns would help us to understand the stages of urban development in a country. Differential growth rates indicate the extent of rural to urban migration and the changes in the structure of city sizes. The new economic policy launched in 1991 was expected to generate higher economic growth and increased urbanisation during the decade 1991-2001. But this has not happened so far, as urban growth has further slowed down during 1991- 2001 after a significant reduction in growth rate in1981-91. Given the increased role of large cities in globalised environment, it is expected further that the cities will grow faster than the small, medium and large towns, but this has also been not found true in the last decade. 1},

This paper is a general equilibrium analysis of urban agglomeration economies due to product variety, and agglomeration diseconomies due to intra-city congestion in a two-city system framework. Special attention is paid to the impacts of transportation cost decrease on urban concentration and dispersion. Our main result is that dispersion necessarily takes place when the transportation cost is sufficiently low. We also conduct numerical calculations using specific parameter values, and depict a structural transition from dispersion to agglomeration, and then re-dispersion when the transportation costs decrease monotonically over time. Finally, we observe that dispersion is usually bad as compared to agglomeration, from a welfare point of view. {\textcopyright} 1998 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The institutional driver, i.e., the relaxation and reform in the hukou system, is considered the most important factor in the increasing mobility in post-reform China in the literature. This paper argues that the above institutional factor was influential in the initial increase of migration in the 1980s. Subsequent increase in the migration scale from 1990 to 2000 was driven largely by rapid and unbalanced economic development in China.The framework of time-space geography is adopted in this study. It is argued that various factors have different characteristics of dynamic response and spatial diffusion. For example, economic reform and open door policy have been implemented with increasing intensity since 1978. But they have a clear pattern of spatial diffusion. The time-space geography of development indicates that some areas would first become major destinations of migration, to be followed by other areas later.On the other hand, the registration of temporary population was introduced in the whole country at almost the same time in 1985. It has one-off impact on migration. But population in less developed areas may respond to relaxed migration control and migration opportunities in advanced areas gradually. Their response time is determined by their migration tradition, ability as well as distance from the destinations of opportunities. This paper makes a detailed time-space analysis of the migration patterns in China using migration data from 1990 and 2000 censuses and 1995 and 2005 population surveys. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Moreover, higher female ownership of local businesses in related industries (e.g. those sharing similar labor needs and industries related via input-output markets) predict greater relative female entry rates even after controlling for the focal district-industry's conditions. The core patterns hold when using local industrial conditions in 1994 to instrument for incumbent conditions in 2000 and 2005.

The econometric results support the hypothesis that income gaps significantly influence migration decisions. When income gap reaches a certain level, the reaction of the migration probability to income gap is weaker for men than for women. The relative income of women is less sensitive to an increase in rural income but more sensitive to a decrease in urban income than that of men. Moreover, we find that the urban to rural income gap is larger for women than for men, which suggests that women receive larger monetary return from migration than men do. In decomposing income gaps, we find that the gap for men is largely determined by differences in the attributes of migrants and nonmigrants, whereas for women, the gap is mainly determined by differences in returns to attributes. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

The results suggest that physical capital investment has no long-run nor short-run effect but the human capital investment has significant long-run effect on per capita GNP; the stock of human capital measured by primary gross enrolment rate (lagged by three years) and openness is found to have a significant effect on growth of per capita GNP. The Generalized Impulse Response Function confirms that the innovation in per capita GNP growth can only explain the movements of the growth of per capita GNP (itself) and investment in education human capital positively and significantly only for a short period of time but does not explain the movements of the investment in physical capital and health human capital. Moreover, the innovation in change in education human capital investment significantly and positively explains the movement of the changes in education human capital investment (itself), health human capital investment and growth of GNP per capita; the innovation in health human capital investment significantly explains the changes of education and health human capital investment only.

A generalised translog production-inverse input demand function is estimated to test for the existence of variable returns to agglomeration in manufacturing, construction and service industries. Two separate measures of urban density, in which proximity is represented by straight line distance or by generalised cost, are constructed and included in the translog to identify the effect of road traffic congestion. The results show that for some sectors of the economy diminishing returns to urban density can set in causing the magnitude of agglomeration elasticity to fall as effective densities increase. The generalised cost based measure of agglomeration produces higher elasticities because it captures both time and distance dimensions of density. A comparison of spatial variance in estimates indicates that road traffic congestion plays an important role in explaining diminishing returns for the most highly urbanised locations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Counterfactual simulations of the model indicate that variation in returns to experience and differences in wage intercepts across location type are the most important mechanisms contributing to observed city size wage premia. Variation in returns to experience is more important for generating wage premia between large and small locations while differences in wage intercepts are more important for generating wage premia betwen medium and small locations. Sorting on unobserved ability within education group and differences in labor market search frictions and distributions of firm-worker match quality contribute little to observed city size wage premia.

This paper undertakes a quantitative review of the empirical literature on agglomeration through a meta-analysis of 729 elasticities taken from 34 different studies. The objective is to make sense of the range of values for agglomeration economies found in the literature by identifying some key characteristics that affect the magnitude of the results obtained. Our analysis confirms that study characteristics do matter. In particular, we find that country specific effects, the industrial coverage, the specification of agglomeration economies, and the presence of controls for both unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity and differences in time-variant labor quality can give rise to large differences in the results reported in the literature. In contrast, correcting for reverse causality of agglomeration does not seem to produce noticeable changes in the size of urban agglomeration estimates. We also test for publication bias and find some evidence supporting the presence of positive reporting bias. The findings support the intuition that agglomeration estimates for any particular empirical context may have little relevance elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Whereas the vast income disparity between urban and rural households is confirmed, it is found that, remarkably, rural households report higher subjective well-being than do their richer urban counterparts. A decomposition analysis explores the reasons for this reversal. It finds that there are many determinants of happiness other than absolute income, and that the determinants differ in the two sectors. An explanation for the puzzle is advanced in terms of relative concepts, income inequalities, orbits of comparison, and degrees of insecurity. Positive and normative implications are discussed.

abstract = {On the basis of the data derived from China's 2005 1{\%} population sample survey, this paper examines regional and personal factors that shape locations chosen by China's interprovincial skilled migrants. It aims to evaluate the relative weight of employment opportunities, and amenities, and the ownership structure of economy in determining skilled migrants' destination choices, and the extent to which such place-based factors work differently among different types of skilled individuals. The results indicate that China's skilled migration is driven mainly by interregional income differentials and that regional variations in amenities and ownership structure play a less important role in this regard. Furthermore, compared with college diploma holders, bachelor's degree holders are more responsive to wage levels and are less sensitive to the risk of unemployment, whereas those with managerial and professional occupations and those without hukou at the destinations are more sensitive to wages and employment possibilities. In addition, there is little evidence that the effects of amenities differ greatly across life-course groups, but those holding hukou at the destinations are more attracted to places with ample government-provided amenities. The findings suggest that at least in the first half of 2000s, China's skilled people prioritise career prospects over amenity-related issues in their migration decisions and that institutional arrangements continue to affect interregional movements of skilled labour in China.

Many of the determinants of life satisfaction in urban China appear comparable to those for people in other countries. These include, inter alia, unemployment, income, marriage, sex, health, and age. Communist Party membership and political participation raised life satisfaction. People appeared fairly satisfied with economic growth and low inflation, and this contributed to their overall life satisfaction. There was dissatisfaction over pollution, but this-like job insecurity-does not appear to have impacted on life satisfaction. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nearly 40 percent of all Brazilians have migrated at one point and time, and in-migrants represent substantial portions of regional populations. Migration in Brazil has historically been a mechanism for adjustment to disequilibria. Poorer regions and those with fewer economic opportunities have traditionally sent migrants to more prosperous regions. As such, the southeast region, where economic conditions are most favorable, has historically received migrants from the northeast region. Migration should have benefited both regions. The southeast benefits by importing skilled and unskilled labor that makes local capital more productive. The northeast can benefit from upward pressures on wages and through remittances that migrant households return to their region of origin. The northeast of Brazil is a net sender of migrants to the southeast. In recent years a large number of people moved from the southeast to the northeast. Compared with northeast to southeast (NE-SE) migrants, southeast to northeast (SE-NE) migrants are less homogeneous regarding age, wage, and income. SE-NE migrants are on average poorer and less educated than the southeast average, while NE-SE migrants are financially better off and higher educated than the northeast average. The authors find that the predicted returns to migration are increasing with education for SE-NE migrants and decreasing for NE-SE migrants. They further observe that the returns to migration have been decreasing for NE-SE migrants and increasing for SE-NE migrants between 1995 and 1999. This finding helps explain migration dynamics in Brazil. While the predicted positive returns to migration for NE-SE migrants indicate that NE-SE migration follows in general the human capital approach to migration, the estimated lower returns to migration for SE-NE may indicate that nonmonetary factors also play a role in SE-NE migration.},

abstract = {The objective of the study is to identify the role of geographical variables in explaining differences in per capita income among Brazilian states. It also aims at ascertaining the degree to which such variables affect convergence or divergence trends in per capita income among these states. In order to investigate these issues it uses micro-data, instead of the more traditional aggregate data, averaged up from household to birth cohort level. Both the level and the change in average household income per capita across Brazilian states are correlated to geographical and household variables. The aim is to capture not only the influence of household human capital and wealth variables on the convergence of per capita income (along the lines of the neoclassical model), but also that of spatial or geographical characteristics, such as public infrastructure, health and education services. Therefore, this paper simultaneously considers data on geographical variables and repeated cross-sections of household surveys. The use of cohort level data means that we can construct cohort/state/year means for all variables of interest and control for state, life cycle and composition effects for the first time in this literature. The results indicate that the geographical variables seem to be important determinants of income levels and growth. Altogether, the results indicate that human capital and infrastructure variables are important areas for government intervention, as these are some of the main factors behind the differences in steady-state rate of income growth in Brazil.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Using a tailor-made panel database for regions in these two countries, we show that both countries exhibit increasingly strong polarization of innovative capacity in a limited number of urban areas. But the factors behind this polarization and the strong contrasts in innovative capacity between the provinces and states within both countries are quite different. In China, the concentration of innovation is fundamentally driven by agglomeration forces, linked to population, industrial specialization and infrastructure endowment. Innovative areas in China, rather than generate knowledge spillovers, seem to produce strong backwash effects. In India, by contrast, innovation is much more dependent on a combination of good local socioeconomic structures and investment in science and technology. Indian innovation hubs also generate positive knowledge spillovers to other regions.},

What are the roles of public infrastructure investments and fiscal incentives in influencing the location and performance of industrial activity? To examine these questions, we estimate a spatial profit function for industrial activity in Brazil that explicitly incorporates infrastructure improvements and fiscal incentives in the cost structure of individual firms. We use firm level data from the 2001 annual industrial survey along with regional data at the microregion level and find that there are considerable cost savings from being located in areas with relatively lower transport costs to reach large markets. In comparison, fiscal incentives have modest effects in terms of influencing firm level costs. Although the results suggest that firms benefit from being in locations with good access to markets, we do not suggest that improving inter- regional connectivity would necessarily assist lagging regions in the short run. Improving inter-regional connectivity implicitly reduces a natural tariff barrier so firms currently serving large markets and benefiting from economies of scale can more easily expand into new markets in competition with local producers. Therefore, producers in the leading regions can crowd out local producers, which would be detrimental for local production and employment in the lagging region.},

Usual measures of dispersion in the interstate income distribution (the coefficient of variation and Theil's index) suggest that sigma-convergence was an unequivocal feature of the regional growth experience in Brazil, between 1970 and 1986. After 1986, the process of convergence seems, however, to have slowed down almost to a halt. A standard growth model is shown to fit the regional data well and to explain a substantial amount of the variation in growth rates, providing estimates of the speed of (conditional) beta-convergence of approximately 3{\%} p.a. Different estimates of the long-run distribution implied by the recent growth trends point towards further reductions in the interstate income inequality, but also suggest that the relative per capita incomes of a significant number of states and the number of ‘very poor' and ‘poor' states were, in 1995, already quite close to their steady-state values.},

We also account for the endogeneity of industrial agglomeration and propose a simultaneous equation model to estimate the determinants of urban productivity and agglomeration. A spatial econometric analysis across 617 Chinese cities in year 2005 shows that the spatial concentration of industrial production is an important cause of higher productivity in large industrial cities and cities in neighboring regions, where higher productivity resulting from concentrated industrial production then leads to further agglomeration in these cities.

We find that productivity of manufacturing industries in China relative to that in India improved substantially over the 1998-2003 period. Specifically, the average total factor productivity (TFP) growth for the manufacturing sector over this period was about 11{\%} higher in China than in India. We document two substantial changes in government policies in China that were not witnessed in India. First, the late 1990s saw an enormous wave of ownership restructuring due to the formal endorsement of private property rights by the Chinese central government. Second, in 1997 a large scale labour retrenchment program was launched to address the long standing problem of labour redundancy in the public sector. Using data from the Chinese survey of manufacturing industries, we quantify the impact of these large scale institutional changes on TFP of Chinese manufacturing industries. We find that these policy changes can explain about 30{\%} of the growth in TFP of manufacturing industries. Hence we conclude that these institutional changes in China can account for a significant part of the gains in productivity of manufacturing industries in China relative to that in India over the 1998-2003 period. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this empirical study, we test the relationship of Chinese urban productivity and city size. Using over 119 790 firm-level production data cross 28 industries from the Third National Industrial Survey, along with the urban population data of 224 cities, we find strong and prevailing significant agglomeration economies in Chinese urban areas. The estimated average agglomeration elasticity is around 0.051, implying that every doubling of city size will provide a 3.6 per cent gain in firm productivity. The breakdown analysis suggests that, based on current data, the major source of the agglomeration advantage comes from localisation economies-benefits from the concentration of firms of the same industry within one geographical area-rather than urbanisation economies-externalities from urban development itself. The maximum size study also suggests that, while most Chinese cities have yet to grow to demonstrate the full strength of agglomeration economies, many Chinese industries have reached the 'optimal' industry size within a 'given' urban area.},

Based on panel data of about 150 Chinese cities during the 1990s, I find an inverted U-shaped relationship between city size and productivity as well as a positive effect of population density on urban productivity. The estimated city size corresponding to the peak point of labour productivity ranges between 3 and 4 million, which implies that most cities in our sample are not large enough to fully exploit productivity advantages associated with agglomeration economies.

This paper reviews and develops some simple models that capture these first and second nature economic geographies. The presence of increasing returns to scale in cities leads to urban structures that are not optimally sized. This depresses the return to job creation, possibly retarding development. Looking at the wider regional structure, development can be associated with large shifts in the location of activity as industry goes from being inward looking to being export oriented.},

abstract = {Place-based or geographically-targeted policy has been promoted as a way to help poor regions and the poor people who live there. Yet, such policy has often been attacked by economists as slowing needed economic adjustments, redirecting resources to lower productivity regions, and supporting political agendas rather than economic prosperity. The spatial equilibrium model in particular predicts that people readily move to the locations providing the highest expected utility, suggesting that policy interventions only impede needed adjustments. Given the high mobility of Americans, the spatial equilibrium model should then be most applicable to the US. We review the empirical evidence on whether the spatial equilibrium model applies and find that, even in the United States, people are not as mobile as the model suggests and that economic shocks have rather persistent effects. Although this suggests the potential need for place-based policy, we describe the informational and political economy conditions that need to be met before place-based policy can be effective.},

abstract = {In the past several years, labor shortage in China has become an emerging issue. However, there is heated debate on whether China has passed the Lewis turning point and entered a new era of labor shortage from a period of unlimited labor supply. Most empirical studies on this topic focus on the estimation of total labor supply and demand. Yet the poor quality of labor statistics leaves the debate open. In this paper, China's position along the Lewis continuum is examined though primary surveys of wage rates, a more reliable statistic than employment data. Our results show a clear rising trend of real wages rate since 2003. The acceleration of real wages even in slack seasons indicates that the era of surplus labor is over. This finding has important policy implications for China's future development model.},

Land area and industrial specialisation also play a significant role whereas the access to external markets does not. Therefore, large agglomeration economies prevail in China and they are more localised than in Western countries. Third, we -find evidence of a large positive impact of the local share of migrants on local workers'wages.

We assess the extent to which worker characteristics (education, age, gender, race, position in the family) and job characteristics (occupational position, sector, experience) can explain wage inequality. The analysis is made both with regional-nominal and with regional-real wage data. In the second case regional price indexes are used to control for differences in cost of living among regions. Wage differentials in Brazil were slightly lowered when control variables were introduced, but the leftover inequality remained high. The results indicate that cost of living levels do have a role in explaining wage inequality in Brazil, but even after controlling for this factor, the remaining regional differentials are still important.},

Low wage dispersion, defined as a relatively small difference between the median wage and that of the lowest paid decile of workers, is associated with high price levels.

abstract = {Despite the availability of more sophisticated methods, a popular way to estimate a Pareto exponent is still to run an OLS regression: log(Rank)=a-b log(Size), and take b as an estimate of the Pareto exponent. The reason for this popularity is arguably the simplicity and robustness of this method. Unfortunately, this procedure is strongly biased in small samples. We provide a simple practical remedy for this bias, and propose that, if one wants to use an OLS regression, one should use the Rank-1/2, and run log(Rank-1/2)=a-b log(Size). The shift of 1/2 is optimal, and reduces the bias to a leading order. The standard error on the Pareto exponent zeta is not the OLS standard error, but is asymptotically (2/n){\^{}}(1/2) zeta. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach over the standard OLS estimation procedures and indicate that it performs well under dependent heavy-tailed processes exhibiting deviations from power laws. The estimation procedures considered are illustrated using an empirical application to Zipf's law for the U.S. city size distribution.},

The mean Pareto exponent for a sample of 44 countries is 1.136, somewhat greater than the exponent of one implied by the rank-size rule. We find that value of the Pareto exponent is quite sensitive to the definition of the city and the choice of city sample size. The significance of non-linear terms in variants of the Pareto distribution also indicate that the rank-size rule is only a first approximation to a complete characterization of the size distribution of cities within a country. The relatively low correlation between primacy and Pareto measures confirms the need for a variety of measures of city size distributions. This paper also suggests that large cities are growing faster than small cities in most of the countries in our sample. This is indicated by the positive coefficient on the first non-linear term introduced into the Pareto equation. Finally, variations in the Pareto exponent and measures of primacy are partly explained by economic, demographic, and geographic factors.},

The manner in which cities of different sizes grow relative to each other is examined and, contrary to the common empirical finding that the relative size and rank of cities remains stable over time, it is found that the Economic Reforms and the One Child Policy since 1979 have delivered significant structural change in the Chinese urban system. The city size distribution remains stable before the reforms but exhibits a convergent growth pattern in the post-reform period. The theoretical literature on city sizes highlights a link between log normal and Pareto distributions for city sizes prompting the employment of Pearson goodness-of-fit tests to examine directly which theoretical distribution provides the best approximation to the empirical city size distribution. Contrary to the evidence for other countries, a log normal rather than Pareto specification turns out to be the preferred distribution. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study the validity of Zipf's Law in a data set of Chinese city sizes for the years 19992004, when the numbers of cities remain almost constant after a rapid urbanization process during the period of the market-oriented economy and reform-open policy. Previous investigations are restricted to loglog ranksize regression for a fixed sample. In contrast, we use rolling sample regression methods in which the sample is changing with the truncation point. The intuition is that if the distribution is Pareto with a coefficient one (Zipf's law holds), rolling sample regressions should yield a constant coefficient regardless of what the sample is. We find that the Pareto exponent is almost monotonically decreasing in the truncation point; the mean estimated coefficient is 0.84 for the full dataset, which is not so far from 1. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Along with the biased linear fit estimate, the maximum likelihood estimate for the Pareto and Tsallis q-exponential distribution has been computed. For India, the scaling exponent is in the range of [1.88, 2.06] and for China, it is in the interval [1.82, 2.29].

abstract = {China's technology parks have been growing rapidly in the decade that followed their establishment. I examine whether this is merely in response to the policy incentives or there have been external economies from the concentration of high-technology firms in the technology parks as policy makers had hoped. Using data on China's 53 national technology parks from 1992 to 2000 and data on the metropolises that host them, I find results that are consistent with the neoclassical growth mechanism-labor productivity across technology parks is converging and there is no evidence of geographical external economies. But the foreign direct investment the host city receives has robustly contributed to the productivity growth in the technology parks. Finally, I find evidence that in their early stage of development the technology parks have hampered the secular trend of increasing regional inequality in China. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Numerous studies have also cited the impact of the country's form of economic development on various skill and occupational categories. On the other hand, macroeconomic models generally simplify labor market processes by assuming a single homoge­ neous national labor market. Arc wages in Brazil, then, determined by isolated regional, occupational, or nationwide factors? This study develops an econo­ metric model for decomposing annual wage changes into national, occupational, and regional effects and applies it to data on male employees in Brazil's major urban areas to test whether the annual wage changes are more similar among occupational or local categories. It shows that wages are affected both by local conditions and national occupational trends, and furthermore that the underlying patterns of regional and occupational wage differentials are quite stable.},

In the second section of the paper, Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis, Markov chains and stochastic kernel techniques (spatially conditioned) are applied to the dataset. The results suggest that, in broad terms, the spatial pattern of income distribution in Brazil during that period of time has remained stable.},

Adjusted data show an increase of 3.8 centimetres in the heights of male Brazilians born between 1939 and 1981. There are also regional differences; in the North and Northeast of the country, heights are about two centimetres lower than the average for all groups. Regression analyses show that proxy variables related to living conditions during bodily growth, and using regional dummies, were statistically significant causes of the variation in the heights. In contrast, colour, urban/rural, and inequality variables were not significant.},

abstract = {Despite tremendous macroeconomic instability in Brazil, the country's distributions of urban income in 1976 and 1996 appear, at first glance, deceptively similar. Mean household income per capita was stagnant, with minute accumulated growth (4.3 percent) over the two decades. The Gini coefficient hovered just above 0.59 in both years, and the incidence of poverty (relative to a poverty line of R{\$}60 a month in 1996 prices) remained effectively unchanged over the period, at 22 percent. Behind this apparent stability, however, a powerful combination of labor market, demographic, and educational dynamics was at work, one effect of which was to generate a substantial increase in extreme urban poverty. Using a decomposition methodology based on micro-simulation, which endogenizes labor incomes, individual occupational choices, and decisions about education, the authors show that the distribution of income was being affected by: 1) Three factors that tended to increase poverty-a decline in average returns to education and experience, a negative "growth" effect, and unfortunate changes in the structure of occupations and participation in the labor force. 2) Two factors that tended to reduce poverty-improved educational endowments across the board, and a progressive reduction in dependency ratios. The net effect was small and negative for measured inequality overall, and negligible for the incidence of poverty (relative to "high" poverty lines). But the net effect was to substantially increase extreme poverty-suggesting the creation of a group of urban households excluded from any labor market and trapped in indigence. Above the 15th percentile, urban Brazilians have "stayed put" only by climbing hard up a slippery slope. Counteracting failing returns in both self-employment and the labor market required substantially reduced fertility rates and an average of two extra years of schooling (which still left them undereducated for that income level).},

abstract = {Nominal wages differ widely across space. Do these differences imply large produc-tivity benefits to moving people across space, or are the differences driven by selec-tion? To answer this question, we construct a general spatial equilibrium framework. Our framework allows us to decompose observed wage differences into four compo-nents: i) selection due to comparative advantage, ii) wedges due to migration costs, iii) endogenous amenity differences, and iv) endogenous agglomeration benefits. We show how migration costs can lead to lower aggregate productivity by hindering the movement of labor to where it is most productive. We then estimate the model using detailed micro data for Indonesia and the United States. Two counterfactuals illus-trate the quantitative implications of migration costs on aggregate productivity. First, we estimate that between 1976 and 2011 migration costs declined by 21{\%} in Indone-sia; the improved allocation of labor to where it is most productive explains a 37{\%} increase in Indonesia's GDP growth over this period. Second, we estimate that migra-tion costs in the United States are 60{\%} smaller than in Indonesia; higher costs of labor movement in Indonesia explain 4{\%} of the GDP per-capita gap between the United States and Indonesia.},

The college tradition in the United States began with Harvard in the seventeenth century soon after the pioneers settled in the new land. These institutions were private, closer to their Board of Trustees than to the British Crown, and had a deeply religious character. Since one of their objectives was to train religious leaders, character formation was very valued. Located far from city centers, colleges used to operate as almost a total institution. The first Brazilian higher education institutions were created in the early nineteenth century when the Portuguese Royal family left Lisbon for its colony, Brazil. Schools of Medicine, Law, Pharmacy, etc. were called Faculdades. Highly elitist they were located in large cities. They followed the model of Napoleonic Great French Schools, which were secular institutions aimed at training professionals. United States and Brazil have quite different higher education systems, but both still sustain, to a large extent, their respective marks of origin and pay tribute to them.},

It is widely recognized that changes in technology and competition have diminished many of the traditional roles of location. Yet clusters, or geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, are a striking feature of virtually every national, regional, state, and even metropolitan economy, especially in more advanced nations. The prevalence of clusters reveals important insights about the microeconomics of competition and the role of location in competitive advantage. Even as old reasons for clustering have diminished in importance with globalization, new influences of clusters on competition have taken on growing importance in an increasingly complex, knowledge-based, and dynamic economy. Clusters represent a new way of thinking about national, state, and local economies, and they necessitate new roles for companies, government, and other institutions in enhancing competitiveness.},

We find significant evidence that technology diffuses slower to locations that are farther away from adoption leaders. This effect is stronger across rich countries and also when measuring distance along the south-north dimension. A simple theory of human interactions can account for these empirical findings. The theory suggests that the effect of distance should vanish over time, a hypothesis that we confirm in the data, and that distinguishes technology from other flows like goods or investments. We then structurally estimate the model. The parameter governing the frequency of interactions is larger for newer and network-based technologies and for the median technology the frequency of interactions decays by 73{\%} every 1000 Kms. Overall, we document the significant role that geography plays in determining technology diffusion across countries.},

In this paper we use a matched worker-firm data set from the Veneto region of Italy that combines Social Security earnings records for employees with detailed financial information for employers to measure the degree of rent sharing and test for holdup. We estimate wage models with job match effects, allowing us to control for any permanent differences in productivity across workers, firms, and job matches. We also compare OLS and instrumental variables specifications that use sales of firms in other regions of the country to instrument value-added per worker. We find strong evidence of rent-sharing, with a “Lester range” of variation in wages between profitable and unprofitable firms of around 10{\%}. On the other hand we find little evidence that bargaining lowers the return to investment. Instead, firm-level bargaining in Veneto appears to split the rents after deducting the full cost of capital. Our findings are consistent with a dynamic bargaining model (Crawford, 1988) in which workers pay up front for the returns to sunk capital they will capture in later periods},

The estimates are surprisingly similar to those found for US cities, with four basic factors (population, income, commuting cost and price of rural land) explaining most of the variation in urban spatial scale of Chinese cities. The findings clearly show that although land use in Chinese cities may have inherited many centrally planned features, market forces today exert a very significant influence. The study also shows that the urban spatial scale of Chinese cities is better understood by a model that consolidates features of both 'closed' and 'open' cities proposed in the standard urban land economics literature.},

On the one hand, the pressures to move the economy again, to confront the problems of sluggish exports, and to lower high unemployment rates, together with the lack of government resources for state and local investments, make it the worst of times for urban development policies. On the other hand, it is generally in periods of strain or crisis that the significance of the urban sector for the national econ- omy is most truly appreciated. Austerity is forcing peo- ple to rethink the fundamental issues of urban develop- ment and the types of policies that can be most fruitfully pursued. This may be the best of times to review policy priorities and to look for robust solutions to urban problems. Before the prospects for urban development policies are outlined, some questions must be answered. What are the characteristics of policies toward urbanization and the policy tools that have been used in developing countries? What rationales are given for those policies? What do we know about the effects and effectiveness of policies? Without answers to such questions it is not possible to examine properly the future direction of urban development policies. Basic},

The model analyzes the contribution of different types of public policies on growth, economic geography and spatial income distribution.  It implies that an improvement in infrastructures that reduces transaction costs inside the poorest region decreases both the spatial concentration of industries, and the growth rate, and increases the income gap between the two regions.  Conversely, an improvement in infrastructure facilitating transactions between regions has the reverse effect.  In this sense, a trade-off between growth and the spatial distribution of economic activities is highlighted.  Contrary to transfers and traditional regional policies, it is shown that public policies that reduce the cost of innovation can attain the objectives of higher growth and more even spatial distribution of both income and economic activities.  From that point of view, these policies seem preferable to the regional policies now implemented in Europe.},

abstract = {College students select majors for a variety of reasons, including expected returns in the labor market. This paper demonstrates an empirical method linking a census of US degrees and fields of study with measures of the knowledge content of jobs. The study combines individual wage and employment data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) with ratings on 27 knowledge content areas from the Occupational Information Network (O
                        *NET), thus providing measures of the economy-wide knowledge content of jobs. Fields of study and corresponding BA degree data from the Digest of Education Statistics for 1976-1977 through 2001-2002 are linked to these 27 content areas. We find that the choice of college major is responsive to changes in the knowledge composition of jobs and, more problematically, the wage returns to types of knowledge. Women's degree responsiveness to knowledge content appears to be stronger than men's, but their response to wage returns is weak. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It examines the income penalty for field of education-occupation mismatches for men and women with higher education degrees in Sweden and reveals that the penalty for such mismatches is large for both men and women. For mismatched men the income penalty is about twice as large as that found for US men, whereas for women the penalty is of about the same size as for US women. Controlling for cognitive ability further establishes that the income penalty is not caused by a sorting by ability, at least for Swedish men. The income penalty for men decreases with work experience, which is an indication that education-specific skills and work experience are substitutes to some extent. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Previous studies on the determinants of the choice of college major have assumed a constant probability of success across majors or a constant earnings stream across majors. Our model disregards these two restrictive assumptions in computing an idiosyncratic expected earnings variable to explain the probability that a student will choose a specific major among four choices of concentrations. The construction of an expected earnings variable requires information on the student's perceived probability of success, the predicted earnings of graduates in all majors and the student's expected earnings if he (she) fails to complete a college program. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we evaluate the chances of success in all majors for all the individuals in the sample. Second, the individuals' predicted earnings of graduates in all majors are obtained using Rumberger and Thomas's [Econ. Educ. Rev. 12 (1993) 1] regression estimates from a 1987 Survey of Recent College Graduates. Third, we obtain idiosyncratic estimates of earnings alternative of not attending college or by dropping out with a condition derived from our college major decision-making model applied to our sample of college students. Finally, with a mixed multinomial logit and probit models and an heteroscedastic extreme value model, we explain the individuals' choice of a major. The results of the paper show that the expected earnings variable is essential in the choice of a college major. There are, however, significant differences in the impact of expected earnings by gender and race. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We show that human capital investment is procyclical in early life (in utero to age 3), but then becomes countercyclical. We argue this countercyclical effect is caused by families investing more time in schooling when outside options are worse. We show that children and mothers report a lower likelihood of work in drought years, and children are more likely to attend school. In addition, we find long term impacts of these shocks: adults who experienced more rainfall during school years have lower overall total years of schooling and lower wages. These results suggest that the opportunity cost of schooling, even for fairly young children, is an important factor in determining overall human capital investment.},

These findings contradict the often repeated claim that employers now seek workers with a good general education and are happy to teach the occupation specific skills necessary to do the job.

The empirical analyses, based on cross-sectional and panel data from the Level of living surveys 1974-2000, are guided by two main hypotheses: (a) that educational mismatch reflects human capital compensation rather than real mismatch, and (b) that educational mismatch is real but dissolves with time spent in the labour market, so that its impact on wages tends toward zero over a typical worker's career. Our findings do not support these hypotheses. First, significant differences in contemporaneous economic returns to education across match categories remain even after variations in ability are taken into account. Second, we find no evidence that the rate of wage growth is higher among overeducated workers than others. Our conclusion is that the overeducated are penalized early on by an inferior rate of return to schooling from which they do not recover. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To understand the joint determination of migration and risk sharing I study a dynamic model of risk sharing with limited commitment frictions and endogenous temporary migration. First, I characterize the model. I demonstrate theoretically how migration may decrease risk sharing. I decompose the welfare effect of migration into the change in income and the change in the endogenous structure of insurance. I then show how risk sharing alters the returns to migration. Second, I structurally estimate the model using the new (2001-2004) ICRISAT panel from rural India. The estimation yields: (1) risk sharing reduces migration by 60{\%}; (2) migration reduces risk sharing by 23{\%}; (3) contrasting endogenous to exogenous risk sharing, the consumption-equivalent gain from migration is 7{\%} lower. Third, I introduce a rural employment scheme. The policy reduces migration and decreases risk sharing. The welfare gain of the policy is 50-65{\%} lower after household risk sharing and migration responses are considered.},

The role of the federal government would be to provide additional finance to those state funds whose value per enrolment would not reach the minimum national value, in order to guarantee a minimum standard of quality. This text emphasizes some of the deficiencies of both funds. One is that they provide very few new resources to the educational system as a whole, since the federal contribution (which would constitute these new resources) was insignificant with FUNDEF and will not be significant with FUNDEB. Another deficiency is that some governments get more than they contribute while others get less, which means that only governments gaining and/or receiving the federal contribution have more chances to maintain and develop education and to valorize their teaching staff.},

It identifies and discusses: the characteristics of the new Fund that were already present in the previous one, the improvements acquired in contrast to Fundef and the different technical choices. The study also indicate the problematic aspects of the new legislation, such as: a) the indistinct use of the financial resources among levels and modalities of instruction, schools, and teaching settings, independently of their respective weight in the collection of resources; b) the inclusion special education private enrollments and those of day care centers in a permanent way, without considering a transitory period. The paper proposes that the financial contribution of the Union to education come back to 1995's level, in terms of the percentage of expenditures by federative sphere.},

abstract = {Cash transfers targeted to poor people, but conditional on some behavior on their part, such as school attendance or regular visits to health care facilities, are being adopted in a growing number of developing countries. Even where ex-post impact evaluations have been conducted, a number of policy-relevant counterfactual questions have remained unanswered. These are questions about the potential impact of changes in program design, such as benefit levels or the choice of the means-test, on both the current welfare and the behavioral response of household members. This paper proposes a method to simulate the effects of those alternative program designs on welfare and behavior, based on microeconometrically estimated models of household behavior. In an application to Brazil's recently introduced federal Bolsa Escola program, we find a surprisingly strong effect of the conditionality on school attendance, but a muted impact of the transfers on the reduction of current poverty and inequality levels.},

In Brazil, several programs of this type existed since the mid-1990s, and came together under a federal program in 2001. In 2004, the Brazilian government brought Bolsa Escola together with other minimum income programs to create a comprehensive family stipend program (Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia). This paper examines the education and equity impacts of education-oriented social programs with data provided by the Brazilian National Household Survey of 2003. The analysis shows that these programs are not well focused from an education point of view. They are better focused from a minimum income policy point of view, but with limitations. The paper concludes that these policies are not properly grounded in research, and are based on wrong assumptions.},

The basic framework is a dynamic Roy model in which a worker possesses two distinct skills that can be augmented by learning by doing. There are different implicit prices, in different countries and different rates of skill accumulation. Our analysis contributes to the literature on the selection of immigrants and return migrants by offering a richer framework that may help to accommodate selection of emigrants and return migrants that are not immediately compatible with the one-dimensional skill model. Our analysis also has implications for the debate on brain drain and brain gain. In the two skills model presented here, return migration can lead to a mitigation of the brain drain, or even the creation of a "brain gain", where those who return bring the home country augmented local skills. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Although we estimate that the income gains from migration are very large, not everyone migrates and many return. Within this group of highly skilled individuals the emigration decision is found to be most strongly associated with preference variables such as risk aversion and patience, and choice of subjects in secondary school, and not strongly linked to either liquidity constraints or to the gain in income to be had from migrating. Likewise, the decision to return is strongly linked to family and lifestyle reasons, rather than to the income opportunities in different countries. Overall the data suggest a relatively limited role for income maximization in distinguishing migration propensities among the very highly skilled, and a need to pay more attention to other components of the utility maximization decision. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Brazil has come a long way from its colonial days where education of the local population had not been a priority. This chapter describes how modern Brazil has extended public basic education to over 95{\%} of the population; established assessment systems using an internationally benchmarked index that measures the progress of each school against a baseline; created student-based funding formulas that distribute funds fairly within states; used conditional cash transfers to lift poor families out of poverty through education; and encouraged states and municipalities to take actions to improve education in individual schools. Brazil has enjoyed 15 years of economic and political stability that has enabled it to develop a range of solid industries that now export to the world. Consumption is up among its citizens and this continues to fuel the Brazilian economy. Average PISA scores for Brazil have improved in all subjects measured over the last ten years. While these scores are well below the OECD average and obviously do not place Brazil among the high-performing countries, such gains do suggest that Brazil has put in place federal policies based on a coherent vision that appear to be generating some consistent improvements. The challenge now is to raise the level of education of its citizens high enough to enable them to take commerce and industry to competitive levels in a global marketplace. STRONG},

abstract = {This paper explores the regional innovation paradox and its policy implications. The regional innovation paradox refers to the apparent contradiction between the comparatively greater need to spend on innovation in lagging regions and their relatively lower capacity to absorb public funds earmarked for the promotion of innovation and to invest in innovation related activities compared to more advanced regions. Empirical analysis of the nature of the paradox shows that there are strong complementarities between business, education and government spending on R{\&}D and that technology/innovation policy and industrial policies tend to work in opposite directions. Our analysis suggests that resolution of the paradox requires policies that: (i) increase the innovation capacity of regions by working both on the demand and the supply side of the system to increase both private and public sector investment in innovation activity; and (ii) integrate technology policy and industrial policy by encouraging expenditure on innovation activity within mainstream industrial policy programmes. The penultimate section of the paper outlines and assesses policy initiatives/experiments along these lines and suggests how they might be developed in the future. {\textcopyright} 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Using data on emigrant stocks by schooling level and source country in OECD destinations, we find that a simple model of income maximization can account for both phenomena. Results on selection show that migrants for a source-destination pair are more educated relative to non-migrants the larger is the absolute skill-related difference in earnings between the destination country and the source. Results on sorting indicate that the relative stock of more educated migrants in a destination is increasing in the absolute earnings difference between high and low-skilled workers. We use our framework to compare alternative specifications of international migration, estimate the magnitude of migration costs by source-destination pair, and assess the contribution of wage differences to how migrants sort themselves across destination countries. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We show how regional growth patterns in China depend on regional differences in physical, human, and infrastructure capital as well as on differences in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. We also evaluate the impact of market reforms, especially the reforms that followed Deng Xiaoping's "South Trip" in 1992 those that resulted from serious hardening of budget constraints of state enterprises around 1997. We find that FDI had a much larger effect on TFP growth before 1994 than after, and we attribute this to the encouragement of and increasing success of private and quasi-private enterprises. We find that human capital positively affects output and productivity growth in our cross-provincial study. Moreover, we find both direct and indirect effects of human capital on TFP growth. These impacts of education are more consistent than those found in cross-national studies. The direct effect is hypothesized to come from domestic innovation activities, while the indirect impact is a spillover effect of human capital on TFP growth. We conduct cost-benefit analysis of hypothetical investments in human capital and infrastructure. We find that, while investment in infrastructure generates higher returns in the developed, eastern regions than in the interior, investing in human capital generates slightly higher or comparable returns in the interior regions. We conclude that human capital investment in less-developed areas is justified on efficiency grounds and because it contributes to a reduction in regional inequality. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Places are shaped by being lived in; they are spaces of encounter where the little histories of the city are played out.

The patterns and rhythms of life in the small spaces of the city are therefore not simply a straightforward projection of civil life. Places are also sites of resistance, contestation, and actions that are often thought to be illegal by the (local) state. After introducing the concept of place, the remainder of this article is a reflection on places and place-making (but also place-breaking) in urban China. Because the patterns and rhythms of urban life have continuity, however, my approach to their study was historical. The story told here is roughly divided into four major periods: Imperial China, Republican China, the People's Republic under Mao Zedong, and the reform period from about 1980 onward.

Autarkic policy prematurely triggers a rapid expansion of heavy and chemical industry (HCI), which matures too slowly. The primary sector must therefore meet the foreign exchange and revenue transfer needs of the economy. But because the primary sector shrinks in relative size as per capita incomes rise, autarkic development proves unsustainable. Yet reform is then blocked by the vested interests that benefit from the rents which autarkic policies confer. Economic growth becomes erratic and slow. In this way a favorable natural resource endowment becomes a curse rather than a blessing, and resource-rich countries underperform, with interesting consequences for regional policy and the role of frontier regions like the Amazon.

abstract = {If one ranks cities by population, the rank of a city is inversely related to its size, a well-documented phenomenon known as Zipf's Law. Further, the growth rate of a city's population is uncorrelated with its size, another well-known characteristic known as Gibrat's Law. In this paper, I show that both characteristics are true of countries as well as cities; the size distributions of cities and countries are similar. But theories that explain the size distribution of cities do not obviously apply in explaining the size distribution of countries. The similarity of city- and country-size distributions is an interesting riddle. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2006 Ohio State University Press},

The empirical study shows that differences in the U.S. earnings of immigrants with the same measured skills, but from different home countries, are attributable to variations in political and economic conditions in the countries of origin at the time of migration.},

abstract = {We recognized that many health outcomes are associated with air pollution, but in this project launched by the US EPA, the intent was to assess the role of exposure to ambient air pollutants as risk factors only for respiratory effects in children. The NHANES-III database is a valuable resource for assessing children's respiratory health and certain risk factors, but lacks monitoring data to estimate subjects' exposures to ambient air pollutants. Since the 1970s, EPA has regularly monitored levels of several ambient air pollutants across the country and these data may be used to estimate NHANES subject's exposure to ambient air pollutants. The first stage of the project eventually evolved into assessing different estimation methods before adopting the estimates to evaluate respiratory health. Specifically, this paper describes an effort using EPA's AIRS monitoring data to estimate ozone and PM10 levels at census block groups. We limited those block groups to counties visited by NHANES-III to make the project more manageable and apply four different interpolation methods to the monitoring data to derive air concentration levels. Then we examine method-specific differences in concentration levels and determine conditions under which different methods produce significantly different concentration values. We find that different interpolation methods do not produce dramatically different estimations in most parts of the US where monitor density was relatively low. However, in areas where monitor density was relatively high (i.e., California), we find substantial differences in exposure estimates across the interpolation methods. Our results offer some insights into terms of using the EPA monitoring data for the chosen spatial interpolation methods.},

abstract = {The measurement of area-level attributes remains a major challenge in studies of neighborhood health effects. Even when neighborhood survey data are collected, they necessarily have incomplete spatial coverage. We investigated whether interpolation of neighborhood survey data was aided by information on spatial dependencies and supplementary data. Neighborhood "availability of healthy foods" was measured in a population-based survey of 5186 persons in Baltimore, New York, and Forsyth County (North Carolina). The following supplementary data were compiled from Census 2000 and InfoUSA, Inc.: distance to supermarkets, density of supermarkets and fruit and vegetable stores, housing density, distance to a high-income area, and percent of households that do not own a vehicle. We compared 4 interpolation models (ordinary least squares, residual kriging, spatial error regression, and thin-plate splines) using error statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) from repeated replications of cross-validations. There was positive spatial autocorrelation in neighborhood availability of healthy foods (by site, Moran coefficient range = 0.10-0.28; all P{\textless}0.0001). Prediction performances were generally similar for the evaluated models (r approximately 0.35 for Baltimore and Forsyth; r approximately 0.54 for New York). Supplementary data accounted for much of the spatial autocorrelation and, thus, spatial modeling was only advantageous when spatial correlation was at least moderate. A variety of interpolation techniques will likely need to be utilized in order to increase the data available for examining health effects of residential environments. The most appropriate method will vary depending on the construct of interest, availability of relevant supplementary data, and types of observed spatial patterns.},

abstract = {We estimate the effect of education on participation in criminal activity accounting for endogeneity of schooling. We first analyze the effect of schooling on incarceration using Census data and changes in state compulsory attendance laws over time as an instrument for schooling. Changes in these laws have a significant effect on educational achievement, and we reject tests for reverse causality. We find that schooling significantly reduces the probability of incarceration. Differences in educational attainment between black and white men explain 23{\%} of the black- white gap in male incarceration rates. We corroborate our findings on incarceration using FBI data on arrests that distinguish among different types of crimes. The biggest impacts of education are associated with murder, assault, and motor vehicle theft. We also examine the effect of schooling on self-reported crime in the NLSY and find that our estimates for imprisonment and arrest are caused by changes in criminal behavior and not educational differences in the probability of arrest or incarceration conditional on crime. Given the consistency of our estimates, we calculate the social savings from crime reduction associated with high school graduation among men. The externality is about 14-26{\%} of the private return, suggesting that a significant part of the social return to completing high school comes in the form of externalities from crime reduction. ∗We},

There is little evidence suggesting large externalities from the level of housing consumption, but there appear to be externalities from homeownership. Externalities from living around homeowners are far too small to justify the deduction. Externalities from homeownership are larger, but the home mortgage interest deduction is a particularly poor instrument for encouraging homeownership since it is targeted at the wealthy, who are almost always homeowners. The irrelevance of the deduction is supported by the time series which shows that the ownership subsidy moves with inflation and has changed significantly between 1960 and today, but the homeownership rate has been essentially constant.},

Homeownership may encourage these investments because homeownership gives individuals an incentive to improve their community and because homeownership creates barriers to mobility.  Using the U.S. General Social Survey document that homeowners are more likely to invest in social capital, and a simple instrumental variables strategy suggests that the relationship may be causal. While our results are not conclusive, we find evidence that a large portion of the effect of homeownership on these investments may come from lower mobility rates for homeowners.

Finally, across cities and counties, areas with more homeowners have lower government spending, but spend a larger share of their government budget on education and highways.},

abstract = {A necessary condition for justifying a policy such as subsidized low-income housing, either via tenant-based rental assistance or construction of public or private projects, is that it has a real effect on market outcomes. In this paper, we examine one aspect of the real effect of subsidized housing—does it increase the housing stock? If subsidized housing raises the quantity of occupied housing per capita, either more people are finding housing or they are being housed less densely. On the other hand, if subsidized housing merely crowds-out equivalent-quality low-income housing that otherwise would have been provided by the private sector, the housing policy may have little real effect on housing consumption. Using both Census place and MSA-level data from the decennial census and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, we ask whether housing markets with more subsidized housing also have more total housing, after accounting for housing demand. We find that government-financed units raise the total number of units in a market, although on average one government-subsidized unit adds only one-third to one-half of a unit to the total housing stock. There is less crowd-out in more populous markets, and more crowd-out in places where there is less excess demand for subsidized housing, as measured by the number of government-financed units per eligible person.

abstract = {When there are binding price controls, there are shortages and the allocation of goods across consumers may not be efficient.  In general, the misallocation costs of price controls are first order, while the classic welfare losses due to undersupply are second order.  This paper presents an empirical methodology for estimating the degree of misallocation of housing units due to rent control in New York City.  This methodology involves comparing the relative consumption of different demographic groups within the rent controlled area with the relative levels of consumption in a free market area.  Our best estimate of the costs of rent control in New York due to the misallocation of rental apartments is 200 dollars per apartment annually.},

@article{Quigley2001,
abstract = {It is generally believed that the increased incidence of homelessness in the United States has arisen from broad societal factors, such as changes in the institutionalization of the mentally ill, increases in drug addiction and alcohol usage, and so forth. This paper presents a comprehensive test of the alternate hypothesis that variations in homelessness arise from changed circumstances in the housing market and in the income distribution. We assemble essentially all the systematic information available on homelessness in U.S. urban areas: census counts, shelter bed counts, records of transfer payments, and administrative agency estimates. We estimate similar statistical models using four different samples of data on the incidence of homelessness, defined according to very different criteria. Our results suggest that simple economic principles governing the availability and pricing of housing and the growth in demand for the lowest-quality housing explain a large portion of the variation in homelessness among U.S. metropolitan housing markets. Furthermore, rather modest improvements in the affordability of rental housing or its availability can substantially reduce the incidence of homelessness in the United States.},

abstract = {This paper uses data on house transactions in the state of Massachusetts over the last 20 years to show that houses sold after foreclosure, or close in time to the death or bankruptcy of at least one seller, are sold at lower prices than other houses. Foreclosure discounts are particularly large on average at 28{\%} of the value of a house. The pattern of death-related discounts suggests that they may result from poor home maintenance by older sellers, while foreclosure discounts appear to be related to the threat of vandalism in low-priced neighborhoods. After aggregating to the zipcode level and controlling for regional price trends, the prices of forced sales are mean-reverting, while the prices of unforced sales are close to a random walk. At the zipcode level, this suggests that unforced sales take place at approximately efficient prices, while forced-sales prices reflect time-varying illiquidity in neighborhood housing markets. At a more local level, however, we find that foreclosures that take place within a quarter of a mile, and particularly within a tenth of a mile, of a house lower the price at which it is sold. Our preferred estimate of this effect is that a foreclosure at a distance of 0.05 miles lowers the price of a house by about 1{\%}.},

abstract = {Abstract In Manhattan, housing prices have soared since the 1990s. Although rising incomes, lower interest rates, and other factors can explain the demand side of this increase, some sluggishness in the supply of apartment buildings is needed to account for high and rising prices. In a market dominated by high‐rises, the marginal cost of supplying more housing is the cost of adding an extra floor to any new building. Home building is a highly competitive industry with almost no natural barriers to entry, and yet prices in Manhattan currently appear to be more than twice their supply costs. We argue that land use restrictions are the natural explanation for this gap. We also present evidence that regulation is constraining the supply of housing in a number of other housing markets across the country. In these areas, increases in demand have led not to more housing units but to higher prices.},

Following Card (1990), I examine the changes in rental prices in Miami and three comparison groups after the Mariel boatlift. This exogenous immigration shock added an extra 9{\%} to Miami's renter population in 1980.I find that rents increased from 8{\%} to 11{\%} more in Miami than in the comparison groups between 1979 and 1981. By 1983 the rent differential was still 7{\%}. Rental units of higher quality were not affected by the immigration shock. Units occupied by low-income Hispanic residents in 1979 experienced an extra 8{\%} differential hike with respect to other low-income units. Relative housing prices moved in the opposite direction from rents in the short run.},

As a first step toward a unified framework, we propose a simple model incorporating differences in technological know-how across countries and differences in productive efficiency within countries.

abstract = {Cedric Pugh argues that past efforts to tackle rapid urbanization and its related problems and constraints have been inadequate, and that the rate and scale of likely urbanization over the next couple of decades pose challenges which require very different and innovative approaches.  The bulk of his paper describes the evolution of policy over the past 30 years within the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the UN Development Program, and the UN Center for Human Settlements, the leading international lending and development agencies concerned with Third World economic and urban policy issues.  Pugh argues that these institutions have learned much from their own experience and that far more flexible and realistic policy changes have been adopted since the late 1980s.  They move away from orthodox neoliberalism and give greater attention to social programs, and emphasize public-private partnerships and the creation of an enabling environment rather than direct state involvement.  Pugh criticizes a considerable number of academic writers for being unduly ideologically driven in advocating statism along socialist lines or a quasi-Western welfare state.  He declares himself an advocate of the New Political Economy, discusses this school of thought, and considers experiences in the Asian NICs, Mexico, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania.},

Using data from the India Human Development Survey 2005, we focus on two dimensions of women's lives: women's autonomy and control over their lives; and women's labour force participation. Results suggest that household structure forms the key mediating factor through which husbands' absence affects women. Women not residing in extended families are faced with both higher levels of responsibilities and greater autonomy, while women who live in extended households do not experience these demands or benefits.},

We find evidence of absolute convergence--initially poor states grew faster than their initially rich counterparts. Also, the dispersion of real per capita state incomes widened over the period 1961-91. However, relatively more grants were transferred from the central government to the poor states than to their rich counterparts. Significant barriers to population flows also exist, as net migration from poor to rich states responded only weakly to cross-state income differentials."},

@article{Hirose2008a,
abstract = {N this paper, a Grossman-Helpman-Romer-type endogenous growth model is developed with two regions in which there are mobile workers and linkage between consumption goods and differentiated intermediate goods. The economy has the potential to reach the following spatial configuration: full agglomeration, partial agglomeration, and segmented agglomeration. In perfect agglomeration, the innovation sector and intermediate goods sector agglomerate in one region. In partial agglomeration, intermediate goods firms partially agglomerate in the region where the innovation sector agglomerates perfectly. In segmented agglomeration, the innovation sector agglomerates in the region where both intermediate goods sector and final good sector do not agglomerate perfectly. In addition, we show the comparison of the welfare of skilled workers in each steady state. Not surprisingly, the welfare of the skilled in full agglomeration is always the highest. However, even though there are transportation costs of final good, the welfare in segmented agglomeration is not necessarily the lowest.},

abstract = {Empirical research on cities starts with a spatial equilibrium condition: workers and firms are assumed to be indifferent across space. This condition implies that research on cities is different from research on countries, and that work on places within countries needs to consider population, income, and housing prices simultaneously. Housing supply elasticity will determine whether urban success reveals itself in the form of more people or higher incomes. Urban economists generally accept the existence of agglomeration economies, which exist when productivity rises with density, but estimating the magnitude of those economies is difficult. Some manufacturing firms cluster to reduce the costs of moving goods, but this force no longer appears to be important in driving urban success. Instead, modern cities are far more dependent on the role that density can play in speeding the flow of ideas. Finally, urban economics has some insights to offer related topics such as growth theory, national income accounts, public economics, and housing prices. (JEL R11, R23, R31, R32)},

The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or "product space," finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries.},

abstract = {For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor. As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

abstract = {Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 {\textgreater}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 {\textless}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta{\textless}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

@article{Glaeser2001,
abstract = {Urban economics has traditionally viewed cities as having advantages in production and disadvantages in consumption. We argue that the role of urban density in facilitating consumption is extremely important and understudied. As firms become more mobile, the success of cities hinges more and more on cities' role as centres of consumption. Empirically, we find that high amenity cities have grown faster than low amenity cities. Urban rents have gone up faster than urban wages, suggesting that the demand for living in cities has risen for reasons beyond rising wages. The rise of reverse commuting suggests the same consumer city phenomena.},
