#  Stages of COVID-19 spread and how governments respond

As the first infection wave of COVID-19 progresses across the globe, more data becomes available, and we start to develop a better understanding of how the disease has spread, and how governments have responded in different countries.

One way of thinking about the progression of the infection wave in a country is to divide it in stages that can be observed in the available data.

This analysis can be useful to anticipate the need for financial and other resources, either for countries that are at earlier stages of the first wave, or in the event of new future waves.

## Five observable stages of a COVID-19 spread wave

A first stage would be before  Because multiple countries [already started formulating response policies ](https://www.devex.com/news/as-global-cases-climb-latin-america-readies-for-coronavirus-response-96620) even before having a single COVID-19 case.
 We can think of the period between the day China  reported the first COVID-case

## Where are countries?

A word of caution. The number of daily reported new cases have [important measurement issues](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#cases-of-covid-19-background).  There are delays between the original recording and the official counting and reporting. It is only possible to detect and infection if the person is tested, but tests are not widely available. And the severity of these concerns varies from one country to another. Hence, [they should not be treated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/opinion/coronavirus-china-numbers.html) as an accurate portrayal of the number of people actually infected with the virus at a given point in time.  However, it is one of the indicators most readily-available to policymakers in real time, and a large number of policy responses to the crisis (including [official U.S. suggested criteria](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/#criteria) for lifting mobility reatrictions after the peak of infections) have been informed, at least partially, by this measure.

Details of how the stages are identified in the data can be found in the accompanying [white paper](https://github.com/jpchauvin/covid_policies/drafts/covid19_infection_wave_and_policies.pdf).

At the time of writing, most countries in the world are still in the stage of accelerating community spread.  This includes most countries in Latin America with the exception of Chile and Ecuador, whom appear to have entered a decelerating stage.
